So what were we to do but head over to the bank.

Well surprise surprise... Arizona still has drive up tellers... That kicks azz! I miss these in California. None the less they also have an ATM island to conduct your bidness at afterhours or if the drive thru is busy.

Pro Tip: Drive thru, walk in, or ATMs who could ask for more?

Well we had a quick n easy trip to this branch. Friendly, lots of AC inside I would imagine (we didn't go in), easy to navigate drive through lanes. What more do you need?

How about a quick n easy transaction and we were in and out and didn't have to leave the car. Talk about nice and wonderfully easy. Great quickie trip to the bank.

I am not writing about this branch specifically, I am writing about EVERY one I have been in within the last year or so. I have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it. The only interaction I ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that's it. It should be so simple, but for some reason it NEVER is! Whether I drive up or walk in, it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank I have ever been to. For reals, it takes me about 5-7 minutes (yes I have timed it) once I am at the teller window. 

So today, I walk in and hand over my check and my slip. After a looooong pause (and way more typing than I believe is required to process my deposit) she asks me to confirm my home address, NOT the business address on the account. I do it, realizing later that I just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail. Then she asks me to confirm my name... yes my name. I do it. She then asks me to sign the check right below where I have clearly written ""For Deposit Only"" and the account number. I do it. Looooooooong pause........ more typing. 

""You're all set, have a great day, sorry I stole 7 minutes of your life"" (I added that last part).

positives:
- 24 hr customer service
- great online banking
- many locations
- text banking
- free checking for students
-upgraded to the next free checking account and now i get free checks too!
- AWESOME savings plans. you can set goals, time limits, auto transfers and it will tell you how close you are to your savings goal. i LOVE this feature.


negatives:
- you have to have your account number (not your debit card number) when you call. maybe im crazy for not having it memorized but it's a pain in the butt
- they charge you for the phone call if they think you could have been able to handle it online yourself( if you call and complain they will usually take care of it)
- there is a $10 transfer fee if you move money from your accounts too frequently or if they need to pull from your savings for overdraft protection
- when i first opened my account i was ready to start building my credit score but had really young credit and they wouldn't give me a student card without paying a huge down payment first. i went elsewhere to open my first credit card but it would have been nice to have them all on one website. Chase ended up taking a chance on me and I have been with them for a few years now(credit card wise, not checking!) and have been satisfied.","review","hFtlFksrcLaWHGPNa6SmeA",3,3,4,"Wells Fargo Bank",9,2.5,"AZ","15760 N Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd

Since that time, I have had to reopen all accounts because of some sort of breach in online banking, and now have been receiving charges for the accounts.  When checking in to it, they are going to start charging me, for no particular reason.  In order to get my free checking, I had to open 2 new accounts to replace one of the accounts, and ""jerry rig"" 2 transactions per month to go back and forth between 4 accounts in order to do this.  Of course that means new checks, fees for this, etc.  Now I log on to my account to find that I have no access to any of my accounts for past statements, even the ones that did not change.

Avoid this location if you can, drive 20 minutes out of the way to avoid the extra 1.5 hour wait you're sure to endure here. It is understaffed, and just inappropriately slow. 

The first time I walked out went like this. I walk in and was greeted by some host type of guy , who asked me what I needed help with. I told him ""wiring money"" , he tells me to go ahead and wait in line to see a teller. 40 minutes later I finally get up to the cashier cage. Tell the lady I need to wire some money, she says ""oh you need to see a banking specialist for that, want me to go ahead and check you in?"" .....I'm mad, still quiet but mad, I explain that I was told by the host to wait in the teller line, and asked if it would be ok if I skipped the people waiting to see a banking specialist since none of them were in line as long as I was. She said......""no sir, I'm sorry, they're checked in ahead of you"" . I told her I know that, but they weren't here when I should have been checked in by the host guy. She apologized again and said ""you're all checked in now, shouldn't be too long"". Haha, not too long indeed , I was 5th in line to see the one banking specialist. The people being helped while I sat at first we're just talking about the features of a debit card and how it worked for like 20 minutes, it was like these 50 something year old people had never been in a bank before, never existed in reality, you should've heard the questions they were asking, it was ridiculous. So I left, it shouldn't take 2 hours of bs to get helped at a bank . Damn. Ok, venting partially completed. Oh yeah, I asked if there was a bathroom,  ""not for customers"". They expect you to hang around in this place for hours and don't think they should let you use the bathroom. It's such a bank like thing to do.

The Texas judge who fired off the order immediately reversed the order and apologized for the mistake AND also said that what Bank of America did was against federal law. So, Bank of America returned our money after about a week but Bank of America has decided to keep $100 dollars for ""legal fees"" and $10 from an overdraft protection fee that cleaned out a savings account when the order was issued. Even the SS agents say this act of seizing death benefits done by Bank of America was illegal in the first place ""but this happens all the time with Bank of America"" they said. 

Oh, I talked to every manager I could at the Bank of America legal department in California until I reached AJ, who said he was at the top of the legal department. He bluntly said, ""we are keeping your money"".

Well Bank of America, you won your $110 for now but you lost 7 accounts already by us closing our accounts to keep you from doing further illegal things to us.

She asked who I bank with and I told her Chase Bank and MidFirst Bank and she asked why I'm no longer BofA customer, I told her that the customer service I had were bad and she asked if Chase is better, I told her yes, and she was surprised to hear that.  I'm surprised that she would think BofA customer service would be better than Chase.

One bad thing about this branch is one of the male teller was picking his nose and teeth at the same time while I was there.  Seriously?  You would do that at the open window bank?  I was originally giving this branch a 3 star, and because of that, I'm now giving it 2 star because of the employee appearance.  Another bad thing about this branch is that there's no drive-thru window teller, they do however have 3 lanes of drive-thru ATM's and one walk-up ATM by the main entrance.  Good location, that's all that's good.","review","NNdfPF-UhvLB8FxbsuSC5A",0,0,0,"Bank of America",4,2.5,"AZ","2902 N 44th St

It's a great location because there aren't often long lines (unless you go on a Friday evening, and then you can forget about it). It's convenient for me, so I'd use it even if it weren't a fast, friendly, uncongested location, but it is, which makes it better.

The staff is helpful if you have any kinds of issues. I had a check card stolen not too long ago, and the people in the office got me a substitute one right away, set everything up to get my new one, and made sure that all the charges that weren't mine were reversed.

I don't know why exactly - but every single time I have ever been inside, it is always insanely busy.

The expansion actually wasn't to the inside, however (at least as far as I know), it was to the outside.  The added several lines to the drive-through.  In a bit of a strange turn, the drive-through lanes are all two deep.  That means that there is someone in the front and someone in the back.  So if you get in the back you'll have to wait until the front person is done.  Think of a gas station, only you can't pull out until they are done.  Even the ATM drive through has two positions.  It's a little strange actually.

Generally the setup seems to move well, but it really looks odd.  Most times I go into the lobby and use the ATM there, because for whatever reason people don't use it.  It's actually inside the doors (which is nice, because some other branches have the ATM outside).  There can be huge lines at the tellers, but there is no one at the ATM.  Often I'll get done before anyone has moved at the drive through lines...","review","-_1ctLaz3jhPYc12hKXsEQ",0,0,1,"Bank of America",4,2.5,"NC","6425 Albemarle Rd

This Wells Fargo is a friendly location. However, the bank did credit $1000 in cash to the wrong account. 

I made a $1000 cash payment toward my personal credit card that was by some means attributed to another customer's account.

This error required me to identify the problem, call customer service and ultimately go into the branch... TWICE! My Saturday morning was spent explaining the problem which was determined to be an error by the bank. After many apologies and a guaranteed resolution within 2 business days I left after being told that the branch manager would contact me on monday to provide an update.

Two business days later I had not been contacted by the branch manager. It seems that Lilit Ovasapyan was unaware of the incident and the fact that her bank misplaced $1000 of a customer's money. I was given a different story and told that it would take 3 business days to correct the transaction.

3 hours of time in the bank, several phone calls, and one week later I am still missing $1000. 

Again, be very careful with this branch. I recommend that it be avoided and that the staff be held accountable for egregious and personally destructive mistakes.","review","BSJIDOwx7cyWBiiYzg_lKQ",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",9,3,"NV","7255 S Rainbow Blvd

Our PTSA was encountering a lot of problems with other banks and opening an account that would suit our needs for a business account.  We discovered the Az PTA works with Wells Fargo directly so our paperwork would be streamlined and easy to set up an account.

We were assigned someone to work with.  The Personal Banker's name was Sabrina Petit.  She was awesome.  Very professional and helpful throughout the entire process.  The first time that I went in, I neglected to make an appointment and was told that Bri had just gone on lunch.  The girl who I spoke with said, ""why don't I call her and see if she can come back, she just left a few minutes ago.""  She called and sure enough Bri said that she could come back!  Really?!?  Great!  She walked me through everything that we needed to do, got the account all set up for the co-signers who needed to complete info, and got our account up and going.  They offered our PTSA no fee checking, which included FREE checks!  Amazing!  If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.  The bank was out of money bags the day that I set up the account.  Bri said that she would set one aside for me when they came in.  Sure enough, she called yesterday to tell me that the bags had arrived and that she set one aside for me.  

Because of the nature of our account (business) and having mulitple signers, we have had to go into the bank several times to finalize signer paperwork.  Bri is always pleasant, patient, and helpful.  I would recommend that people ask for Bri - she was great.  So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!  

Oh and hey, you can't beat the popcorn machine, water bottles, cookies and sometimes lollipops that are in the lobby!  I wonder how many times my kids will ask to go to the bank to check the balance of their savings account in the hopes of getting some popcorn and a lollipop.......","review","lzzQ-pSFsP00aIH3bZgbAQ",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",8,4,"AZ","5120 S Lakeshore Dr

Fort Apache), and my ex-housemate used to bank at this location when it was still Wachovia.  But our latest banking crisis lead to Wachovia being swallowed up by Chase, and now we have a bunch of these rebranded Chase locations around town.

Before today, I have never been inside this location, so I can't say what exactly they did to the interior of the bank. But it does not even look like a bank, in the traditional way.  Meaning no bulletproof barrier and counter separating you and the tellers. But there is still the counter with the deposit slips and courtesy pens to help you fill out your forms near the enterence.  There is still the rope and stanchion to queue banking customers on a busy day (which it was not on my visit just 10 minutes ago).

Anyway, I thought it is kind of refreshing how Chase is going out of their way to try and make the banking experience more personable (at least at this location in Summerlin).

There are 3 tellers stations and one desk for the rep that is going to handle opening new accounts and what not.  And all of it is situated inside a large room without partition (not including the one in the front that helps block out the sun and some of the heat, once you get past the small ATM room.

I don't bank here currently, but I may have to occassionally drop by to make deposits into my parents account in the future.  However I might down the road, seeing that there are hardly any HSBC locations in Las Vegas and the lines at Wells Fargo have always been crowded whenever I have to see a teller.","review","XHkzCzmIAB3DnjQO7v6jww",0,0,0,"Chase Bank",4,4.5,"NV","9151 W Sahara Ave, Ste 100

They run his debit card from the 2nd institution where he has his money and BofA says it's too much and it won't process.  So he calls the other bank, we wait for about ten minutes and when he gets the larger amount approved to be run through his debit card, the teller at the window unapologetically tells us that because she already ran his card once she can't do it again.  Why didn't she tell us the precaution before she ran the card in the first place?  Or how about telling us after it was rejected once that she cannot run it another time and so don't waste 10 minutes of our time calling the other bank to get it approved?  So we run to my bank, Wells Fargo, which I have been a faithful member since age 16, and the process was so turnkey and friendly.  No charges, just smiles and a 'have a happy weekend!' on our way out the door.

A while ago, I came to this branch just to deposit a check. I don't know what it is with the Wells Fargo branches in Las Vegas, but there seems to be a serious lack of envelope-free ATMs here. I guess I was spoiled when living in Southern California. I rarely had to step into the bank because any check deposited through those envelope-free ATMs would post to your account the same day and the funds would be available immediately.

Anyway, I'll be nice and not name the teller and personal banker that helped me that day. They were trying to get me to open another account with them. I had to stand there and listen to them explain how every customer should have 5-6 different accounts under their name because of security reasons, all those scams going on, etc., etc. Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to say and believe me, if I was a millionaire and had nothing better to do, I would love to put all that money in 10 different accounts. But it was a busy day for me, I had tons of stuff to do, and I really didn't have time to hang out at the bank. So I politely declined, thanked them for the information and told them that I would definitely keep that in mind. A few days later I noticed that they opened 2 new accounts under my name without my permission! WTF?! I called the branch and talked to the manager. She was actually very nice, apologized to me, got everything resolved and told me that she would have a talk with those two employees.  

That's scary knowing that they have shady employees here, so watch out! I'm avoiding this branch forever!","review","_lmMNw0STDLEI1_qEro6Mg",0,0,2,"Wells Fargo Bank",8,3,"NV","2501 S Rainbow Blvd

Long lines, huge hassles, and employees not fit to be working at a fast food joint.  I had a nice employee once.  Literally, once.  Every other time, my transactions are brutally trying.

I closed my personal account years ago after getting the run-around at their downtown Glendale location.

When I opened an account for my class at this particular location (only because I had to), the business accounts employee looked mortified when I handed her a couple hundred dollars in cash to deposit.  And she almost wouldn't take the change because it wasn't in rolls until I explained the idiocy of asking me to do this when there wasn't enough of each coin to make a complete roll.  Then, she kept miscounting the amount and telling me my deposit number was wrong because she couldn't understand the concept of a $2 bill.  Thankfully, she's not there anymore because she got promoted. Yup, promoted.

I had to call the 800-number to try to get an untrustworthy person's credit cards canceled on one of our accounts.  Guess what they told me?  That they couldn't cancel him unless they had the number on the card, but we didn't have the cards with the numbers on them in our possession, thus the reason behind wanting them canceled.  After I pointed out the ridiculousness of this policy all I got was ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.""

Grrrr! I could go on and on because every transaction at Wells Fargo has been somewhere between aggravating and enraging.","review","SBbftLzfYYKItOMFwOTIJg",1,1,4,"Wells Fargo Bank",5,2,"AZ","1530 N Scottsdale Rd

When asked to speak with a higher up, I was told they are too busy for a customer who has been banking with them for the last 7 years. She said that I should go ahead and Stop the transfer and then dispute the $29.00 after I was already charged for it AND THEY ALREADY HAVE MY MONEY....Of course i got NO guarantess that they would credit me for that...THEY ARE ROBBING THEIR CUSTOMERS BLIND, I TELL YOU BLIND...
And you have to set up/ link a Savings account with them, but seems I can't ever save becasue they keep charging me for the saving account...

James reassures me that everything will be taken care of and every time he reassures me that ""everything will be taken care of"" I know I am in good hands and I can go about my day not worrying about a thing. 

I moved to Boston a few Months ago from Scottsdale. There is no WF in Boston...but I have been working with James who always makes me feel like I'm a priority and when I call him and leave him a message...my phone call is returned in a very timely fashion. I'd just say he's probably one of the reasons I have not switched banks all together and decided to stay with Wells.  I love working with him, it's great to know that customer service still exists.

I mean, I know Banks already are making too much money for them to know what to do with, but who decided that they should spend it on 30 magazine subscriptions and back-lit shelving?  

Gotta say, the wait in line on a Saturday, which would have been otherwise pretty icky as can be expected, was totally improved by that TV.  Everyone in line was watching it.  No deep sighs at the wait.  No frustrated looking at the watch every 2 minutes.  Hmm... Maybe that was money well spent?

I called to cancel the service only to find they charged me a fee for speaking to someone to cancel the service.  Needless to say, I took my money elsewhere and haven't looked back.  

On occasion, I have checks from Wells Fargo and as there is a location near my house, it is convenient to stop there and cash them.  Up until today, they have been cool about it and haven't harassed me too much about becoming a customer.  

They've followed suit with Chase and now make you go through this ridiculous ""check verification"" process.  The teller sends me over to another teller where I wait in line behind Cowboy Bob who is talking incessantly about his grandchildren.  I wait and I wait and I wait.  About 15 minutes go by and I start attempting to telekinetically staple the tellers to their desks.  One of the tellers notices that I am getting angry and may possibly have a gun in my purse so he sends another teller up to help me.  

As the guy is verifying the check, he asks me if this is a business check.  I say ""It's just a personal check.""  He says ""No, what I mean is did someone pay you for a service?""  

What I want to say: 

""Yes, I am a very expensive prostitute.""  

What I do say: 

""It's just a personal check.""  

He then asks me if I'm happy with my bank.  I say that I am and he proceeds to ask me why I didn't take my check there.  I reply, ""Because I felt like bringing it here.""  

We do have a local bank that we don't love.  I MIGHT have been open to coming back at some point but if this is how they treat their non-customers, I don't have a lot of hope for how they treat their actual customers.  I would hate to think that someone who has every right to cash a check that I wrote them would be put through this kind of hassle.  

I left before actually stapling a teller to a desk.  This is probably the best possible outcome.","review","kpbhy1zPewGDmdNfNqQp-g",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,2.5,"AZ","2745 W Carefree Hwy

The lines are never short, and though I wouldn't say the staff (who always seem to be in short supply) is unfriendly, they generally overdo it trying to upsell me on their services. I used to bank with them but they closed my account, and won't let me open a new one (though I owe no money). Still, every time, I get the same ""Would you like to open an account?"" when I come in to cash a paycheck drawn on their bank.

I went there in March 2013 with 7000 dollars to deposit in my account. This  money was my moms which is visiting here from South America. I offered her to keep her money in my account while she is here in Arizona.
I filled in my deposit slip. Teller asks me to ""wait"" while she goes to the back and counts the money. Well, she comes back to the front to tell me that there is only 6000 dollars in there. I told her I was absolutely sure i had 7000$.... And told me to go ahead and count.  Of course, the 1000 missing were not going to be there anymore. 

Ok. I filed the complaint to the manager in charge of the branch. She said she was going to start an investigation and they would come back to me in a few days. She did follow up with me for about a week, with no answers from the security company that was supposed to be going to review the cameras and the videos.... Well, this was almost 4 months ago. Never got any answer, and of course,i as the customer, ended up with the short end of the stick. I lost 1000 dollars, that the teller was supposed to count IN FRONT OF ME,but she did not, and also, being completelly ignored by the staff of the bank who never gave me any answer. I will cancel my account with htis bank, and will make sure people knows about the poor service that i received after losing my money. I still cant believe this situation happened in this bank.","review","F1240KctRkPvv4Q44ANivQ",0,0,0,"Chase Bank",4,3,"AZ","5238 S Power Rd

I just learned that Bank Of America does not want customers to come in their branch locations. Last month I attempted to deposit a check from my Chase account to a BofA account that did not belong to me and they would not let me. So I deposited it to mine and transferred to the other. I got my statement and they have charged me $18.50 because I made a teller assisted deposit to my account.

I am in the bank now learning that if you have an electronic account, they do not want to see your mug in the branch ever. Since they had to look at me last month they charged me.

The branch manager Crystal Padua, at the Spring Valley Las Vegas branch REFUSED to do anything about it. Instead she and the bank prefer to loose a customer. They did, I closed my accounts.

I hope others get fed up with Bank of America's ""Holier-than-thou"" attitude and close their accounts.

What a useless as, Clark Howard says ""Customer No Service"", bank.

Stay away from Bank Of America, all branches, if you need to open an account and cross them off your list if you are looking to open a new account. They do not want you in their branch.

They tried to tell me I wouldn't be able to get a temporary card and asked if I could live without it til the new card came in in 7-10 business days. That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life, so that was why I closed my checking and saving accounts right then and there. Went in today to have something notarized (since I had my credit card with them still), but just got turned away because I didn't have a real account with them. I guess having just a credit account with them isn't enough. I couldn't believe that they turned me away. The least that they could've done was charge me for it like every other bank, but no, the girl had asked the GM and came back to me saying she couldn't do anything for me. I've come here previously when I still had my account to get another document notarized and they were very pleasant. This time around was the last straw I had with Wells Fargo.

Unlike my local bank in Illinois where everybody really cared who you were and called you by name. So I guess what I'm saying is that the big money center bank should just stop pretending about being my buddy and just get on with the transaction. It's only business, trust me. 

I guess my bullshit meter finally couldn't take it anymore today. Sort of like when you deposit over $10,000 in cash at the teller window and they ask for your driver's license and start inputting information but don't explain why they need to do that and act all serious about it.

I tend to stay loyal to a business as long as the customer service stays good but I've gotten tired of this giant bank's policies and I'm itching to go with something smaller like a local credit union. 
I started to notice ridiculously high fees for things that should not incur a fee to begin with. For instance, I get charged to put money INTO my savings account and then I get charged even more if I or they have to pull it back into my checking. They call this ""overdraft protection"", but it's MY money coming from MY savings account not a line of credit.  Don't banks like for a person to put money into their savings account? 
While shopping around I have found that the credit unions tend to not do this or if they do charge, they charge a nominal fee for removing money from savings usually only if you do it more than so many times in a month.  NO ONE ELSE charges you to transfer money INTO your savings like Wells Fargo does!
Bottom line is, I have no problem with the customer service at this particular branch or any Wells Fargo branch I've used,  but I think Wellls Fargo charges fees for  things they shouldn't and too much at that. I also think it's the more ethical thing to do to switch away from big banks like Wells Fargo. I'd rather keep my money local unless it benefits me financially to not keep it local, which is far from the case with Wells Fargo.  I'm switching to a credit union.","review","rRVzKWAcHONxKqkXktj7xg",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",6,2.5,"AZ","2123 W Happy Valley Rd

Rodney was the one ""helping"" me. He refused to allow me to open an account because ""chase frowns on people opening accounts to cash checks and then later closing them.""  Well then why wouldn't you just let me cash the check?!? I told him I needed to open an account anyway as I don't currently have one. His response? ""Well, it's twelve dollars a month...""

I left feeling insulted.

Even the people waiting in the long line looked depressed.  But, what do you expect when you have to entrust your money to such a lackadaisical place! I couldn't take the decrepitude, so I left. 

I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and maybe not even the inside pages either because the actual book could be really good, but I really hope they hurry up and do something with the place, or I'm gonna need to take some Xanax or Cymbalta before I venture inside again.","review","oIVsVM8H273aoT1JUmsDIg",3,4,3,"Bank of America",4,2,"AZ","5755 N 19th Ave

The branch itself is conveniently located, parking easy, nice inside. I came here a little after 12p on a Wednesday- there were only 2 windows open, both helping customers. The tellers seemed to both have a really happy friendly attitude. When I got there I was the only other customer. Along w/the 2 tellers, there were at least 3 other employees (manager, etc) just roaming around.. All very smiley & enthusiastic looking. Problem is- even though I was the NEXT customer in line, I still waited 20-25 min- & none of the smiley people roaming around acknowledged this, offered to help, etc. 

At the branches I frequent when people are waiting too long, the mgr jumps in & opens a window... or invites you over to a desk to be helped (not to mention they also greet you at the door or shortly after you've entered, offer you a water, otherwise attempt to acknowledge & be helpful). All I had was a simple check to deposit into someone's acct. By the time I was seen there were 8 people in line & still just the same 2 very nice but very slow tellers. 

It's one thing to be super busy & slammed during rush hour. It's another to be completely dead yet oblivious to your customers- smiley or not. 

I avoided a nearby branch inside a grocery store (Fry's on 7th ave & Camelback) & chose this one.. Thinking a stand-alone branch would be better. I was wrong. The next day when I had to go back to the bank I went to the Fry's location- where I received prompt friendly service & was in & out in 2 min.

I'm going to be moving back to Phx part-time, & I definitely have no need for this branch w/ its sub-par ability to acknowledge & help its customers.

They may have good intentions and want to protect their customers from fraud, but they also happened to be grossly incompetent or under trained to the point they can't even setup accounts they are recommending.

Came in on three separate occasions to resolve this issue with their 'free' checking and savings account for making small debit and web purchases, but they can't setup the account correctly because the new accounts were never linked to the primary checking/savings accounts.  How I was able to setup monthly recurring transfers with the new accounts, I will never know.  To add insult to injuries, I never even received the card that I was supposed to use for said small purchases, while protecting the primary accounts. The first card probably got lost in the mail, as I moved shortly after and it probably didn't get forwarded to the new address.  The second one, I can't explain.  Maybe I should have made arrangements to physically pick it up from the branch, as they can't stuff envelops and mail it after forcing everyone to go paperless.

Anyway, the staff are pleasant enough but have limited ability to refund monthly fees that were charged, except the immediate 3 months that they can view on their screen.  And after a lot of investigation and tracing the problem to issues linking these new checking and savings account to my primary ones, they said it was ultimately my responsibility for not monitoring my accounts. Never mind that they screwed up in the first place, or the fact that I have no access to it and no reason to monitor it.  Hell, I doubt some thief can fraudulently access the $200 ($162 after WF took their cut) in the account, if I can't even get to it.  And if they can, then hell they deserve it.  Escalated this to their new branch manager,and she also was unable to do anything, after promising to look into it.

I used Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. 

If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.
The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise.
]In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

Perhaps a federal credit union will be a better choice.","review","nBqU_AHXCayr3BQWzfyB5A",1,0,3,"Chase Bank",5,3,"AZ","675 E Camelback Rd

The tellers for general banking needs are usually pretty polite, but anytime I have any other question or issue, I've always walked away more confused and frustrated than before. Every once in a while I'll experience great service, but it's very rare.

I just moved to this side of town, so I went to this location for the first time. I wanted to ask why I all of a sudden started being charged $6 a month for on-line banking while I was living abroad, hoping to get a refund or at least make sure I would stop getting charged.

The phony high school student working as a bank representative there did stop the charges, I'll give him credit for that. (This requires signing up for a new ""free"" banking system that requires you to use your B of A credit card once a month or face a $15 fee. And no, on-line purchases don't count. Go figure.)  But when I asked about refunds or at least finding out why my account changed without my knowledge, he said something about his computer being down and that he would call me within the week to let me know.

It's been a month now. Guess if I've heard from him. 

I was also supposed to get new checks for getting the new account. Nope! Not yet, anyway!

Since I've been a B of A customer I've dealt with $1400 in bank fraud, (which they refunded and then suddenly took back out of my account when a representative made a typo on the amount,) have received checks with the wrong account number on them and then denied new checks when I didn't bring one in for proof, have been denied a bank letter required for a student visa, have been charged fees for not having money in an account I'd already closed, and countless other annoyances that are unacceptable for banking.

I was hoping this branch would be better! Disappointed as usual! 

I know basically everyone is disatisfied with their bank in some way, but does anyone have any suggestions for when I finally decide to leave the dark side? Chase? Desert Schools?","review","PB5f_4Ojjv6Nf-iGg6JN3Q",0,0,0,"Bank of America",4,2.5,"AZ","2998 N Alma School Road

The only problem is that with some of these new methodologies, they cannot provide their customer's with copies or images of the cancelled checks.  But they won't admit their deficiency in this area.  They make up all kinds of excuses like the check must have been damaged or lost in transit, but I know that this is total B.S. since when I look at my checking account, the checks from all the EXACTLY SAME ESTABLISHMENTS ARE THOSE WHERE CANCELLED CHECK OR THEIR IMAGES ARE NOT RETRIEVABLE!!

Now this gal is obviously more experienced and knowledgeable and I tell her my saga again.  She says that whomever gave me those stories were wrong.  There are no restrictions on trust accounts preventing me for transferring funds from or to those kinds of accounts.  

So she shows me how to do it.  While she is showing me, I notice that she goes thru a series of internet maneuvers that differ slightly from what I have always used, but she says that sometimes you have to use a work around to get around the bugaboos with their computer systems -- WTF???  How the heck am I supposed to know that???

In any event, she solves my problem but I still do not feel comfortable with the way WFB has these ""issues"" with their computer systems that you need to understand the ""alternate methods"" to get done what you want done.

I have also, for the most part been a happy customer - until recently.

My niece took a Chase money order that I gave her down to cash it at the this branch, the branch I purchased the money order from.  They would not cash it.  Though she had two pieces of ID and I even called and told them that she was my niece  - I was told in no uncertain terms that her state issued drivers license had a number that was not clear and therefore they would not cash it.

She went two blocks down and cashed the money order.  Last I recalled money orders were like cash and she presented what they asked for.  Worst I think for me, was that the person I spoke to had zero interest in what I had to say.  She was short, to the point and cared not whether I continued to bank with them or not.

That was two days ago. Today I called to verify that a cashiers check that I had purchased at Chase had indeed been cashed.  When I called the 800 number I was treated as I had become accustom to being treated by Chase.  The home office folks did all they could do but told me that I had to call the branch I actually got the cashiers check from, lucky me, the Peoria branch.

And guess what, when I called they listened..then the person who answered the phone said ""You do know it's 4:45 and we close at 5:00... I am with a customer at the moment (they answer the phone while they are with a customer??) so she proceeds to say... I will have to take your name and number and someone will call you back.

Do you know... she only asked for my first name and when I asked her to repeat  my number she said ""no I got it"" and hung up.

I do not know what is going on with this branch or chase as a whole but it is pretty disappointing as I have been one of those customers that frequently recommends them.  In fact, I hold a position in a very large company with thousands of employee's.  We are a company who requires direct deposit and I use to encourage my employees to use chase.

That will no longer be my recommendation.  I train folks on customer service and it only takes a few bad experiences to change an entire companies reputation.  This branch is putting it all on the line for Chase in my opinion.

I have not changed banks yet, but I have definitely changed branches.","review","QHcpSdlArOgi9OGYPVIzjQ",0,0,0,"Chase Bank",3,3.5,"AZ","2950 W Peoria Ave

I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us. 


I used Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

I just got back form being screwed by this bank, seeing as I'm not a customer there, but simply went in to cash a check drawn on their bank.  After ten minutes of ID's, data entry by the teller, thumb printing, etc.  they were ready to cash the check and then they tell me there's a $7.50 fee to do that.  I said that's ridiculous, as the check is drawn on their bank, and the teller manager Ruth Martinez tells me that the fee is NOT a Wells Fargo fee, but a fee that goes to the company who issued the check. LIES! I asked her twice about that statement and she lied both times.  I then called the company that issued the check, and sure enough there is no ""fee"" that goes to them.  Ruth refused to speak to them to hear it from their own lips. I asked that they waive the $7.50 charge, which is totally in their power to do so.  She said no.  I then waited for the branch manager who basically said the same thing. 

Sooooo, for $7.50 they will get bad press (deservedly so), I will never bank with them or go in their branches again, and I'll relate this story to all who will listen.  On a final note, there is a great employee there named Andrew who was very helpful.  You'd think in the era of supposed ""customer service"" it wouldn't be worth receiving a scathing review for $7.50.

I've banked at Bank of America for 25 years, and any problems that have arisen have been handled right away.  I know others haven't had the same experience, but I think they are much better than most.

This Wells Fargo is located off Silverado and Bermuda.  This is also one of the busier ones inside since it's fairly close to Las Vegas Blvd and in a busy shopping center.  

My biggest issues with this location is;

1.  No drive thru ATM.  There's a drive thru, but it's for El Pollo Loco.  I've been fooled the first time I came out here and thought I was in a ATM drive thru to find it out that it's for El Pollo.  As a result, found myself ordering some chicken. 

2.  The lines during the day are crazy long and it seems they take forever at this location. I know exactly why the lines here are long and you can thank guys like my brother-in-law that will only take money out of his own bank to avoid additional chargers. I probably spend more money on gas than the $2 additional charge.  

I get my hair cuts at the Xpress Cuts located in the same parking lot. So, I really have no choice about hitting this Wells every once in awhile.

They called and told me that it came back non sufficient funds and I explained it never hit my Chase acct and would show  them. They did not want to hear it. They could not even figure a way for me to deposit the 200 in to bring it back to positive

They are closing my acct after only being opened a month or two. No other issues and absolutely no over draft charges or anything else. I have deposited checks from my other acct into Wells Fargo so I could use my atm card to avoid monthly service fees until I direct deposited into my acct. Possibly they did not like that, Just another corporate non caring, (this is the way it is) business!!!

I called Wells fargo. They said that it showed a warning and they never actually hard deposited it into Chase. I advised that I have over draft protection and it would have cleared no problem and they could care less. I do have a recording from Chase saying that it was never deposited. Wells Fargo really does not care and just completely shunned me. I was about to add my direct deposit and refinance my car through them. I am glad this happened now.

I have only had two problems worth mentioning.  The first was the branch manager, who just seemed too busy and stressed out.  When she tried to help the banker who'd asked her a question to help me, she went halfway... like someone who wants to appear like they're being helpful without actually having the time to be helpful.  Since I rarely have to deal with managers in a bank, I'll hardly hold that against them.  More often than not, I'm just using the drive through ATM.  My second complaint is that a teller accidentally held on to my debit card after a transaction, having taken it behind the counter.  When she called me later to tell me I'd left it, she insinuated it was my fault for being forgetful.  I'll split that blame down the middle.

Located on the corner of a busy intersection as they are, it can be difficult to get in the parking lot without disrupting traffic.

I need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14. 
I'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!

I stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care.","review","GoymUzKqvET2QOZkIWZi9w",0,1,1,"Bank of America",5,2.5,"AZ","605 E Bell Road

My appointment was at 3:00. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal, but when I got here my customary 5-10 minutes early, I just so happened to sit next to the guy ahead of me, whose appointment was at 2:00. That's about 55 minutes late for those trying to keep up with all the numbers.

A few minutes ago, roughly 3:05, I was acknowledged and told she was running ""a little behind."" The acknowledgement was appreciated and saved a 2-star rating.  Knowing he was an hour past his appointment, I asked for a guess at how long it would be, to which I was assured ""about 30 minutes.""   He was finally called back shortly after that, and I continue to wait.

I've been with Bank of America for somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years or more.  I like the bank, and the people at this location and most of the ones I dealt with in Florida are friendly.  However, I can't help but feel it's not too much to ask for a simple phone call to let someone know when you're running 30-60 minutes behind. 

While the company as a whole I would rate 4 stars, this branch doesn't quite make that level, and hence the 3-star rating.  Before you think me to picky based on a single experience, I'd like to note I've been irritated here before.  In addition to the time issues I experienced today, I've also found certain others at this location to be a little pushy when it comes to Bank offered services (credit cards, retirement plans, etc). I realize this is probably a system thing and not a location thing, but it hasn't been like this at other branches.

I'm finishing this up, now the 30 minutes later I was told, and eagerly await my turn so I can finish up and enjoy the rest of my day off. Fortunately they seems to be wrapping up.

I can't say much about the interior and the face-to-face service. I've probably only been inside once. I usually use the drive thru ATM. Theirs uses that weird inline design where you have two machines in a row. So if you're in the rear ATM and the person in front of you sucks, you have to wait for them. Similarly, even if the front ATM is free, you still have to wait if there's a car at the rear machine.

Other than that, it's A-OK. I'm only reviewing this for the FTR anyway.","review","ifFTbGgwjXALO1PgMHzrTQ",1,2,1,"Bank of America",9,2.5,"NV","4112 Blue Diamond Rd

I rolled up to this BoA to grab some cash (many ATMs outside and drive through, folks) and more importantly, to acquire a certified check. These are the errands that I truly despise, because past experience has shown that certified checks can be obnoxious and take a while. Plus, I also needed a notary. Another potentially laborious process. But guess what? The very nice teller took care of my certified check in 5 minutes and directed me to their notary just a moment later. And the icing on the cake? The notary service was free.

If you thinking openning an account -- run while you can and save your soul. I have explained to the customer service 50 times yes, 50 times over the last 5 years that website sw is broken. But they have the intelligence of a goat and when you explain to them the website is broken it is like explaining theory of relativity to a goat. I will give you few examples and it has been like this for  years. If you ask the sw to give you chart of your balance for last 12 month in June, it will stop in April. Today is June. In a different part if you ask for 12 mo of transactions it will give you few weeks and then dies. There was actually a time when it computed the total of my 2 savings and checkings account and came up with a WRONG number. I went to the local branch and the manager added the numbers using hand calculater and the number was different from what the website reported. So basically these people are stupid all the way to the CEO Moynihan (and including). He delegates his work the ppl in the executive office, and those ppl are just as stupid as customer service. Today I spent lovely time with a woman with the intelligence of a goat in the executive office her name is Charlotte Gimmel. She is so proud to work at the executive office telling she will solve the problem. So I asked her where did she get her computer degree from -- too stupid. But the stupid woman refuses me access to an IT person how their sw is f-----d up. So again, if you did not yet open your account at the hell of a bank run and save your soul. They do trully have infinite amount of stupid people. I have spoken to at least 50 and the low intelligence trash do not have the intelligence to read and understand what I already told them 50 times. They must actively hire only stupid people bc I have not found one who is smart from the CEO Brian T. Moynihan to the customer service. Brian, if reading this, get a job in food industry.

So, I call the phone number, key in my account number and a few other things and before the automated system tells me the card is activated, it goes in to a sales pitch for credit monitoring. Finally it tells me to press 2 if i am not interested, which I promptly do.

This is the worst, least customer service oriented corporation I have ever worked with in my life. E-V-E-R!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A rundown:

Started an account and wanted a higher interest rate so I chose a Market rate SAVINGS account. The bank manager set me up with over-draft protection and I went home happy.

Got an over-draft fee. WTF.

Called the customer service number. Was told that my bank account was not eligible for over-draft protection because it was actually a checking account called a Market Rate SAVINGS account. The fees stood. WTF.

Received a notice in the mail (from BOA I thought) saying that there had been a lawsuit for over-draft fees. 

Called the customer service number again. Spoke with an agent who cheerfully remarked ""oh, that's silly that your account isn't set up for over-draft protection. Let me take care of that"" and refunded me the fees.

Got an over-draft charge. WTF.

Called and explained that I had been told by a rep that my account was eligible for over-draft protection. Was accused of lying because the system said that the fees had been refunded based on a ""courtesy"" as opposed to a ""bank error"", talked through the most laughable investigative process and told that the fees stood - there was nothing I could do to change it. WTF.



About 5 WTFs and several hours on the phone in, I realize that every transaction that is not a WTF transaction has been an error. I now see that Bank of America is the kind of financial institution that will find any manner of unethical ways to profit from the little folks so they can bask in their spoils from the sweeping veranda of their Italianate mansion in Saint Tropez, cognac in hand...or at least fund the exploitation of 3rd world countries the world over.

**Boring story**

I put in an online request for a transfer last week, and a couple days later I got an email saying that the transfer had been initiated.  The days since the request have been the busiest I've ever experienced, leaving little time to think about sleep, much less think about my money.  Today, I needed to get a cashier's check, but when I went to the bank, I found that the transfer never went through.  So, I spent 20 minutes on hold with customer service while they tried to figure out why it had been canceled.

**End boring story**

Okay anyway.  The gist is that the transfer didn't go through, but they never let me know that they had canceled it.

Dudes.  If my shit doesn't go through, fucking tell me my shit didn't go through!  How hard is it to set up automatically generated emails to let people know stuff?  If the universe weren't looking out for me, this could have spelled disaster for my new living situation...and made my already tearfully stressful life, well, disastrous.

In addition to all this, they have different systems for California, Washington, and the rest of the country, which makes my banking life even more complicated because my account was opened in Virginia, I live in California, and spend a lot of time in Seattle (woo!).

On 3/16 I used my debit card to pay for my prescriptions. I knew before hand that it was going to cost quite a bit of money. The clerk charged my account for 1,200 dollars which was the mistake. She immediately electronically refunded the money to my account. I did not pay any attention to my balance thinking that the refund would went back in to my account immediately. This morning 3/19 I received an alert telling me that my fund is below my set limit. I immediately logged into my account ; I found the charge and did not see the credit. I called Boca customer service she told me it is their rule that the refund would not be credit back for 5 days. I complained that they took my fund immediately but yet 15 minutes after noticed the mistake the credit was made; I have to wait for 5 days it does not make sense. ""Well this is the rule.

"I3AF57q9EyNALE9rA37o6A","2012-07-24","xsIzZIYIzebtd841usaPgw",1,"(Update: I guess I was getting too noisy, because my mortgage was dumped onto another lender so I don't have any more recourse. Do not do business with these liars and thieves.)

I was offered a loan modification, were misinformed about process and our payment was increased instead of reduced. Caused us to file for bankruptcy.

One year after I bought my house, I received a notification that there was a mistake with escrow the way my mortgage was written, and that my payment was increasing by nearly $200. This was not something I was capable of doing, I signed a specific mortgage to make a specific payment. So, in 2010 I applied for and was considered for a loan modification, after signing on with a third party agent who failed to perform any of his duties and forced us to file a lawsuit, we contacted BofA directly who finally claimed to get the unfinished paperwork processed and started the modification process.

The first packet we receive for our three month ""trial"" period stated a new payment that was an INCREASE of approximately $300. I called specifically about this and arranged an in-person meeting with one of their loan modification specialists at one of their corporate centers in my home city of Phoenix. I was assured every time that this increase in payment would not be permanent and it was a direct result of being behind on my payments. I reluctantly accepted this, and forced my way through the further burden on my finances. 

After my three month trial period, I received my final paperwork. Contrary to everything I was assured by every level of employee at Bank of America I could contact, the $300 increase was, in fact, permanent. Managers I contacted to complain behaved as if they were doing me a favor because despite the $300 increase, the months I was behind were being forgiven.

So, they were basically telling me I could accept the new payment and be forced to file for bankruptcy, or deny the new payment program and face foreclosure instead.

In doing this, Bank of America caused me to file for Bankruptcy in order to keep my house. And were thoroughly unapologetic and unwilling to correct this injustice.

It has been over a year now, and we have just completed our Bankruptcy and had the case closed. What do I receive in the mail? A statement from Bank of America saying I owe late fees on my mortgage payment (approximately $250) that they refuse to correct, which was a direct result of removing our mortgage from their Bankruptcy department and failing to inform us of doing so. Then, I was sent (via overnight FedEx) a packet that they claimed I requested for a Loan Modification.

When we called to complain, we were told that this was just ""mass mail"". Not only is overnight FedEx not mass mail and clearly a lie, their records should show more than clearly that I had been thoroughly through a ""Loan Modification"" program with them previously. This is a gross misappropriation of funds and just further evidence of their negligence and abuse toward their customers.

A letter of complaint was written onto their Facebook page. It was deleted with no response. Bank of America agents are unwilling to correct their own errors and rectify the abuse I have suffered by their actions. I have been mistreated time and time again by this organization and they do not care. I have finally had enough. I can provide any paperwork necessary to substantiate my claims, but it is nothing that Bank of America does not have on record.

We have filed a complaint with the BBB (CASE#: 438356), and will continue to complain to every organization we can until this is rectified. I have been abused by this organization quite enough, thank you very much.","review","yJ22u_1l01H4NM3wCowIKw",0,0,2,"Bank of America",3,1.5,"AZ","201 E Washington St Fl 20

Attempted to withdraw $ for a bike cab when in Phoenix using my bank's card. Their ATM proceeded to charge me the withdraw amount plus $3 but game me no money. When calling the branch to ask for ATM reconciliation, nobody picks up the phone. If anybody has been to downtown Phoenix during the day, they would know only people at conferences are walking around that section of town so I couldn't imagine who they would be helping. After getting routed to their 800 line several times and being told to only the branch or my bank could start that process I decided to give them the ol ""call repeatedly until someone picks up."" After about 30+ tries, I reached a girl who told me only the phone support number could start this process. Explained to her that several agents had told me the branch had to start this process and ask to be introduced during a transfer to someone who could help. Guess what? I was just sent to the start of the 800 menu again. Was not able to reach anybody after another 10 calls, I gave up defeated but still victorious.

While at some point, I am sure I will write a story with my experiences in sorting out the financial cluster-fuck my mom created and didn't leave a master map for - it will probably need to be marketed as fiction, but still quite entertaining as long as it didn't happen to your life...today is not that day - so I will skip some of the more sordid details for now.

For Yelp review purposes - FIVE visits to the bank, in person, dealing face to face with people, to continually be given partial information, irrelevant information, and negligently incorrect information.

All for a halfhearted apology and a bottle of water. Lovely.

Here's the thing, Wells - my mother had accounts with you for many years. My stepfather has an account with you. Had I been treated well, had I been treated with any value and respect and even a modicum of interest, I may have started an account with you. I would have been a relatively easy sell. However, not only was I not convinced I'd get stellar service if I were your customer, I was so disgusted by the horrible communication and mediocre at best service that there's no way I'd ever consider an account with you. You effectively drove away my business before you even got it. 

Granted - I am not the Sultan of Brunei or any relation to Bill Gates - the lack of my business won't effect your bottom line in any notable way. You'll never feel the pinch of having driven a way a potential small time checking and savings account customer. But if you keep it up, there may be enough of us that is DOES make a difference. Try to remember that.","review","45V7-1r79DEG0HbuaKYIlg",1,1,1,"Wells Fargo Bank",3,1.5,"AZ","13015 N Tatum Blvd

Chase waited to reach out to the wrong beneficiary. The wrong beneficiary spent all of the money to payoff her debts despite knowing they were not hers. Chase was able to recover some of the money. The wrong beneficiary no longer has the money to return the remaining $4135.00.

Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) on banks funds transfer states that if there is an account number AND named beneficiary mismatch that Chase should not have allowed the wire transfer to occur. It did. The fault lies on Chase.

I have voice recordings of Chase daring me to pursue legal action. I have pursued mediation, Chase declined--I have letter of proof from the Neighborhood Justice Center (NJC) of this. According to my contact there, Chase scoffed at her when she invited them for mediation. Nonetheless, she was shocked.

I worked specifically with a banker named Gia Tongol (I believe that's her last name).  Awesome gal.  Answered all of my questions dealing with my account and was able to find out about anything that she didn't know about (which wasn't much).

As far as service goes, she did everything I asked of her and was very cheerful and good with conversation.   Everything else in the transaction seemed to go fairly smoothly.

I don't go into banking centers often, so it was nice to actually take care of business and have it run as smoothly as it did.  Especially when it took less than an hour and I had budgeted more time due to my experiences with general bank services in the past.","review","P4HgVeyXQEtt62qUiYo_jw",0,0,0,"Bank of America",12,3,"NV","7280 S Rainbow Blvd

With ""Keep The Change"" they round every transaction to an even dollar and deposit the change in my savings, after a year they match it up to $250. The teller suggested when I pump gas I stop on .01 so I deposit almost $2 in savings every time I fill up ($1 of mine, $1 on B of A).

I banked with them for a couple years. a few months after I turned 18 they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great bc I was still learning to balance a checkbook and hardly ever had more than $200 in my account at a time. I filled out all the paper work and the teller said it would be applied right away as a back up.

Well, that didn't happen. I overdrafted several times thinking it would pull it from my card and ended up with almost $300 in overdraft fees. 

I went into the bank and they had no idea what I was talking about with that student credit card, and had no record of my paperwork or even saying that i would like them to open it.  

she then explained to me that my paper work have been misplaced. this is when i freaked out.

THEY MISPLACED my social, my address, name everything for anyone to be able to steal my identity. they have no record of ever having it and said i should be fine bc it was probably shredded if it was found. ya, not if a criminal found it! 

I then had to put a bunch of red flags on my social so that no one could do anything with my name or ss#. 

They wouldn't waive any of the fees bc they didn't think it was their fault. I paid them off and switched banks and i will never bank with them for anything ever again.","review","hFtlFksrcLaWHGPNa6SmeA",1,0,4,"Bank of America",3,2.5,"AZ","6501 N Scottsdale Road

The employees on the phones, processing payments, supervisors, managers, ALL have trouble understanding that the customer I s why they even have as job. I had payments applied to incorrect accounts which I sent on time, but   instead of applying to correct account, they sent back to me as a check, with no explanation or warning about the teal account showing the payments now as late. They never fixed my record of 100% ontime payments to reflect that's what happened. They took a payment out of my hank account unauthorized then refused to refund it even when the other bank manager called them. while hole they showed it as late, their phone reps called and insulted me  saying I couldn't do the math necessary to realize how being late affected my loan, actually saying this, not simply implying  it. When attempting to speak to a supervisor or manager, it became obvious the prior phone reps had misrepresented me in their notes, so the manager began talking down to me in a terrible way, saying that the phone reps yelling at me and cutting me off were behaving appropriately and I was just mad because I hadn't paid my bill and didn't like that a collector was calling me.. The pattern of talking over my sentences while trying to explain my problem with the phone reps was now clear - it is under the guide of their terrible management that these crooked shysters are lying in their notes that a customer is not cooperative whole they aren't even listening to what the customer is trying to say, and they just put whatever they want I  the notes and try to billy people into kayo g when the account is merely one payment late. yep, only in 30 day status, the due date that would make it 60 day status hasn't even come around, and this manager threatened that he was just going to have the car repo'd ! what a joke this Butthole was, since he obviously does not know a customer of 5 years with a perfect history that is about to pay off a loan is not going to get repo'd, and in fact is likely to buy a new car soon and therefore a valuable resource of potential future revenue for the bank. and they are accusing me of not being able to do the math?!?

I asked for the signature card to my Safe Deposit Box to add a name to it. It turns out the bank couldn't find it. After 20 minutes of looking they ask me to come back tomorrow with an appointment.

On September 11th, I went back to the bank at 3:00 for my appointment with Ms. Susan Mowatt. She was very nice in helping me. But unfortunately she still couldn't find my signature card. She found my son's safe Deposit signature card, but couldn't find mine. I explained that this was the SECOND TIME they lost my signature card. It's like losing my passport. I was very concerned. Then, from another desk came the manager, Ms Carina Mettlin, who was there the first day, held a grudge against me because the previous day I came in ""too late."" But if I came in when they were closing, why wouldn't they just tell me it's too late? I got there at 4:45pm. Didn't think it was a problem.

She was telling me that they were NOT supposed to help anyone after 4:30 (Like they were doing me a favor!) I said I am concerned that this bank lost my signature card for the second time. Ms Carina Mettlin started raising her voice to me, which I thought was very unprofessional. She said ""We didn't lose your signature card, we 'misplaced it,' and it will take 48 hours for us to try to find it."" Doesn't 'misplacing' something mean that they lost it? She then accused me of raising my voice and said ""I'm DONE WITH YOU,"" like she was dismissing me. Like a school teacher. As I was walking out, I decided to ask for a manager. She refused, and just gave me information to email higher management. I found this infuriating and am very disappointed in this whole situation. Last thing she said to me in a condescending way, was ""HAVE A NICE DAY.""

Don't go to this bank if you need good, reliable service. And try to avoid Ms. Carina Mettlin.","review","yzBPw-GtGgnK5xYCIBiUgw",0,0,0,"Bank of America",10,1.5,"NV","6900 Westcliff Dr

The most recent experience at the drive thru was the one to make me want to write the review.  I was very impressed by the drive thru service. Having previously worked a bank drive thru, I know how easy it is to forget the customer service that comes naturally (at least for some people) when interacting face to face.

The teller greeted me way before I was even ready to send my transaction thru the tube (showing she was paying attention and acknowledged that I had arrived), she very kindly told me what she needed me to send her (so there wasn't a lot of back-and-forth tubing to take up a lot of time and make that awful loud noise), she filled out all of the slips so all I had to do was sign my name and she delivered on my every request (specific bill denomination, in an envelope) with a smile.

Banks are banks (just like cell phone companies).  Most products and services and fees are almost interchangeable, you have to find the one that fits your needs.  Working within federal guidelines and having to stay competitive, keeps them all fairly similar.  What makes the biggest difference is the people that work for the company and the way that you feel when you are interacting with that company.  To me, this was a great example as to why I like to bank with Wells Fargo.","review","AirVzN1BVQBmq5zY0YMNYQ",2,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",11,3.5,"AZ","4823 E Ray Rd

I went in because I was having a problem with a  vendor charging my checking account and over drafting it.  Prior to this the only other time I have been charged a any fee was when they switched my account and the bank kept on billing me for a monthly fee in error which they reversed.

A girl sat down with me and went over my account.  She was courteous but kept on trying to get me to sign up for things.  I told her I was good but she continued for several minutes until finally she asked what she could do for me.  Funny thing is when I sat down I told her exactly why I was there.  I repeated why I was there and she looked through my account again, the previous ten minutes she looked at my account I guess was just to try to sell me something.  I explained to her about the bank errors fees being waived.  After a long pause she said she had to talk with her manager about reversing the fee and she got up and left.  

Another 7-10 minutes later she comes back and says she couldn't waive the fee.  When I asked why? She said because they had already waived monthly fees.  AGAIN I explained to her that those were waived  because of a bank error.  I asked if I could speak to her manager but she said he was busy and couldn't talk with me.  

At the end of the day the fee didn't bug me as much as the TREATMENT.  They had me there for 20 freakin minutes and this guy couldn't come out of his little back door to talk to me for 2 seconds?  Also,  if you weren't going to waive it why not tell the person in the first few minutes, why drag it out for so long?

In the end I called the 800# and they waived it right away. If the people at this branch had bothered to read the notes on my account like the agent at the call center did they could have resolved it then and there.  Instead they were inept and a total waste of time.","review","LS1CRfOX3ydk7xkkCUYgmQ",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",11,3.5,"AZ","4823 E Ray Rd

I understand that banks can get very busy at times, but during this particular time, there was no one in line. I went straight up to the teller, swiped my card, and gave her my savings bond to cash. It seemed like everything was running smoothly, but then a few minutes passed without her saying anything while she shuffled through her drawer, so I began to get antsy. She then told me that she ran out of cash out slips, but that was already a few minutes after she wrote across my entire savings bond, so I just kind of stared at her and said, ""ok"" because I didn't know how she wanted to solve the situation. She told me to hold on so she could try and find some, then she walked away into some other room. I figured it would only take her a couple of minutes, but I was wrong...again. She ended up taking 12 minutes (I know this because I started timing the whole process on my phone) and when she came back, she informed me that she was still unable to find any cash out slips.

 WTF! I was really annoyed at that point because I was already late to meet my boyfriend and she didn't seem to be handling the situation professionally (she NEVER apologized for the wait). Her last resort was to just stand there in front of me, shuffling through her drawer and repeating ""I can't find any"" until the teller next to her said, ""here, why don't you just use one of mine and we'll just tell the manager later."" Seriously, that took 2 seconds. These people obviously need to work on their team work, customer service, and organization skills. I literally stood there for 23 minutes waiting to have my tiny ass savings bond cashed. If she didn't completely write across it before finding out she had no cash out slips, I would've just taken it back and walked out.","review","-K3ZjROK0ml2P-Rk7ttHzA",0,1,1,"Chase Bank",5,3,"NV","8174 S Las Vegas Blvd, Ste 113

I nearly felt forced to give my number, so I gave it to him quickly in hopes he wouldn't hear one of the numbers.  Apparently, it wasn't quick enough because he literally called me for 2 weeks straight and left me a voice mail to come back in and open that new account.  Also, while at the teller... I asked about a sign I saw on the window at the front.  It was some feature where you can scan your check and deposit it via phone.  I asked the teller if this was something that was available for the Blackberry.  Instead of knowing the answer, the teller had to search for the answer.  I guess that's good that she didn't just BS me with an answer, but at the same time; I feel as if that is something that she should have known.

This place also happens to win the award for worst Bank of America in the world!
I would expect such poor service from a Chase, but getting rude and incompetent service from a BOA is very unusual. 

All the workers here are angry and hate the actual concept of work. This attitude is typical of people who live here in Las Vegas. The reason why unemployment rates are so high here in LV is because people hate to work, and when they are forced to work they bring their lazy d-bag personality to the workplace. 

The midget they hired as the receptionist does nothing but condescends anyone who asks questions. His job only requires him to do one duty during the course of his 4 hour work day, and that lone duty they give him is to answer a few simple questions... yet somehow he can't even get that right. He is really defensive and passive-aggressive and does nothing but argue and snap on customers. An example= Some old man came up to him and asked him a simple question. He in returns just screams: ""How is that my job? Stand in line and wait for a teller! That's why we have lines to stand in! Did you think all these people were standing in line for nothing!"".   

The banker I saw didn't do sh!t. The moment I sat down at her cubicle, it was obvious that she just didn't want to do any work. She was very unhelpful, lethargic, and lazy. The only skill she had was her incredible ability to avoid any type of activity that would be considered work. All I wanted to do was ask questions about upgrading my account and she calls the help-hotline on her desk phone. She then hangs up and tells me: ""sorry the helpdesk seems to be offline. There is nothing I can do. Come back later"". I then asked her to order me some new checks and she is like: ""uuuuggghhhh....I'll do it later"". WTF! She then tells me to leave and that she swears she will do it at a later time when she feels like it. She also promised to call me and confirm she did it. Guess what, she never called. She didn't do Sh!t! I logged onto my online banking a few minutes ago and noticed that she didn't even do 1 thing I asked her to do. I also wanted to update my address and she didn't even do that. The sad part is that she and the rest of the bankers here are probably at home right now in their Siegel Suites apartments in North Las Vegas, complaining about how ""the MAN"" makes them work their ass off for 18 long and grueling hours a week.

Bank of America should fire these people. These people don't deserve a job that pays over min-wage. These guys ain't even qualified to pick up dogsh!t on soccer fields. These guys ain't even qualified to wear a Lady Liberty costume and twirl a sign that says ""Tax Returns 20% off"" at the corner of Maryland and Flamingo. I wouldn't even let these guys be around money in the first place. I seriously doubt these bankers can even count to 11..so how you gonna put them in a job where they handle money? That' f*cking nuts!","review","oyKF6Zs4aEYjsFVV9nT2AQ",2,5,0,"Bank of America",4,2.5,"NV","4801 W Charleston Boulevard

Being that it's on the corner of Durango and Warm Springs, it can make entering and especially exiting the parking lot a bit of a hassle.  It's just a very busy intersection with a non-stop flow of cars from all angles, so waiting a few minutes to pull out can unfortunately be normal here.

It is near the edge of the city's development, in the SW side, so maybe that is why there were not that many people in this branch location in the afternoon (2:30-3pm).  Which was great for me, as waiting in line is something most people would prefer to do less of.

The teller that assisted me was very friendly (only 2 were on staff at the counter when I was there), made casual conversations and attempted to get me to open a BofA account with them (after asking some questions and making an assessment to determine if the customer could benefit from opening a BofA account).  This is what all the tellers should be doing, and she did it very well.

Anyway, I did not open an account, as I was just there to deposit rent I collect on behalf of a friend.  But the entire process was quick and efficient, and service was provided by friendly staff.  So easily 4 stars.

Oh yeah, they have one ATM in the front,for customers that are there after business hour or have simple tasks that can be done with the ATM.

If I am in the area and need to step inside a BofA branch, I will definitely pick this one.","review","XHkzCzmIAB3DnjQO7v6jww",1,2,4,"Bank of America",4,2.5,"NV","10114 W Flamingo Rd

Also, apparently they charged me the wrong interest rate on my credit card for over 10 years. A couple months ago I did get a refund from them after they audited their system and that was a nice surprise, but one is left to wonder what may have been different if I hadn't blown all that money on the wrong interest rate to begin with.

Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . 
       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a ""bank error "" they said. You damm right there was !!
       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem.

I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.  I closed my account and switched to a smaller credit union and I couldn't be happier with my decision.","review","BFSUSDK2h3yNG6kCE7KwIw",0,1,5,"Bank of America",5,2,"NC","8551 N Tryon St

Instead, you have to go down a narrow driveway behind the bank--not one of the safest places to get cash at night.

A-OK--barely.","review","Iu3Jo9ROp2IWC9FwtWOaUQ",2,1,2,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,3.5,"NV","1121 Las Vegas Blvd S

I went to this bank and they made me wait 45 minutes. He first had to verify that I had a loan and then made some excuse as to why it took so long.

I always use the ATM for all my banking needs. I have never had a problem and like the convenience of not having to wait in a line and I can go at any hour of the day or night. When I have been inside to speak with a personal banker, I have never seen lines though! The ATM takes checks as well cash for deposit with no use of a deposit slip. YAY! It is much more convenient to just put it in the ATM instead of having to fill out a deposit slip and dreading to lick the envelope. You can choose the option to print check images on your receipt if you feel weird about just sticking money in the ATM.  

Parking can be tight at certain times, but it is a busy shopping center. After hours you will need your Chase card to enter and make any type of transaction at the ATM.","review","2HmHgW3hRYvXYFmQyQtLuw",2,0,2,"Chase Bank",3,4.5,"NV","1990 Village Center Circle, Ste 7-8

We had original poa of course that had been notarized as required by law and directed by attorney. The young lady helping us( if that's what you want to call it) made a phone call then proceeded to tell us it was Nevada law that a family member could not be named  on the power of attorney !   Then writes a Nevada statue down for us to look up that supposedly supports her out landish response to our request. After speaking to our our attorney turns out this statue is of course bogus and does not pertain to this situation at all.

If this bank's customer service reps are uneducated in such important sensitive matters they should  point you in the direction to someone in the bank that has common sense and is educated !

I left behind a Huntington bank and I absolutely adored them. I have never had any hassles with them and my banking life was a breeze. Well, I needed to deposit cash because I didn't have my debit card on hand, and when I walked up to the counter, the teller told me that I was signed up for some kind of an E-Account? Granted that part is probably my fault, because I signed up the day after moving here and had no idea what the guy was telling me when I signed up. Well, if I wanted to deposit my cash, it'd cost me $8.00. I have NEVER heard that in my life! They said that my account was strictly for going to the ATM only, and any transactions made inside would cost me money. This is totally new to me, and I'm not very excited about it. The second thing, I never got my temporary card. I had to go in there and ask them to remail it. Very frustrating when all your cash is in an account that you can't even go inside to use. They have a few good things too, like the referral system, and the matching savings, but overall, I expected more.","review","hYpCpleBxL5h4jz3HeNqGw",1,0,1,"Bank of America",3,2.5,"NC","4401 Randolph Rd

Any of the times I've needed to come in for various in-person tasks, their bankers have been friendly and quick to provide you with service.  The first time I went in to open my account, I was attended by this super cool gal and we chatted it up for a good while after talking account stuff and then realizing we had quite a bit in common.  Most recently when hubby and I went in for another in-person task, their banker, a latin gentleman (from the same country as my parents) attended us very well - we also ended up chatting it up for a bit after we all realized we had a lot in common.  I can honestly say these two people I point out here could easily be cool and good friends.  I guess all that goes to make you feel like they hire people like ""you and I"" and so that is comforting when you are giving Chase your business and your time.

The bankers and tellers I have interacted with at other Chase Bank branches across the US from Denver, NYC to Lexington, Ky have been incredibly helpful and expeditious when assisting me. And the drive thru tellers are usually kind at this branch. 

However, today, I sat for 30 minutes, with a grumpy toddler, waiting to be helped. And there I sat, with only one person acknowledging me. She offered my child a lollipop and kindly informed me she had an appointment with a client or she would have been happy to help me, until I decided to leave. 

Not one person, after the friendly banker, popped over to say that they were going to take a while with their current client or gave me an approximate wait time. I even approached a teller who had no customers in line, to inform them that a fellow customer and I both needed help and that we had been waiting for some time. After a quick apology from the teller and my returning to the waiting area, still no one assisted us. There was no sense of urgency from the employees.

In short, it was a very disappointing customer service experience. After a meltdown from my toddler and 30 minutes of total waiting, I needed to leave and so I did. Without an acknowledgment of my presence or of my leaving. 

I bank with this branch only because it's conveniently close to my home. But, from now on, unless absolutely necessary, will I go into the lobby to be assisted.","review","zJVFiu4WkSUmjnML8ElMxQ",0,0,1,"Chase Bank",3,2,"AZ","1025 W Queen Creek Rd

Tough to say a whole lot about a simple deposit at a non-peak time.
They always seem to be efficient when I come in. Walked to the counter, started filling out my slip, walked straight to the teller window and she knocked out my transaction in about a minute, with some cash back. About 16-18 months ago (in my guess) they put up the glass (bulletproof I again guess) in between the customers and the tellers. Seems very secure to me, the glass in my estimation is about an inch thick, so all you would be robbers, beware!!! haha :)

Side note: Appears $$$ Mayweather banks here too, he rolled up as I was walking out with a backpack full of what I can only imagine would be rolls of cash. His driver was standing next to his Maybach ($500K) and then an identical car rolled up which I can imagine is his matching second car, just in case something happened with the aforementioned backpack. Crazy how much money people have. He needs to fight Pacquiao soon so he can buy another couple cars and flaunt his riches to us commoners.

Opened a wells fargo account two months ago, one of the questions my fiance and I asked was about their over draft protection. We were explicitly told by the banker who helped us (her name is Eva Meneses) that if for any reason our rent was due and the money was not yet in our account, that wells fargo would cover us, charge us a $35 fee and that would be that. We found out recently that not only was overdraft protection activated on our account, the type of account we have would not even allow us to have over draft protection. We called the 24/7 number to see what was happening originally because it was past the business hours of our local branch and they again told us that our overdraft protection was there. When we confronted the branch manager (Bronson Manivong) where we opened the account he then told us that our account would not qualify for overdraft protection. I called the number back again to put in a complaint with them about how we have been lied to by the customer service number and the branch and they then told me that even if we would qualify for overdraft protection it is at Wells Fargo's discretion if they cover the charge or reject it. I have never been ran around in more circles, or lied to so much by a company in my life. After two months my fiance and I are officially going to close our accounts and find a bank somewhere else to handle our money because neither of us wants our hard earned money in the hands of people who have done nothing but lie to us from the moment we opened our account.","review","GbGOJFwNexj6cYRQhcTxRw",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,3,"NV","10475 S Decatur Blvd

But, not so with Wells Fargo and especially this mini-branch inside a Safeway Supermarket. I have had my personal accounts there since 2007, but what really made me appreciate this branch was when I started doing business banking there. First, I opened a business checking account for the advertising payments I started receiving from Google for a couple of my blogs. Then, when we grew the business and incorporated as Automotive Media Partners, LLC I went to this branch to meet with them. The business banking manager walked me through various options for setting up our new company accounts, handled everything very professionally and provided a level of service that exceeds what I have come to expect from banks. He set up accounts for AR, AP and Equity. The Wells Fargo banker set up my Merchant Services account so we could take credit card payments... At a discount rate of 2% and 2.25% for Amex (very low cost). Then he went on to approve a line of credit for the company that far exceeded what I expected.  AMP has exceeded our revenue forecasts for 2012 and I am appreciative enough for Wells Fargo and the way this branch treats me an my company to be fiercely loyal. My investors have tried to get me to move accounts to B of A and I have insisted that we keep our growing business accounts with Wells Fargo and this branch.","review","4HVJGaN2l3i-yk1cdoq4QQ",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",3,3.5,"AZ","90 S Val Vista Dr

I've been a BofA customer for years.  I started with them when I opened my first bank account in Georgia close to 15 years ago.  I stick to the ATMs and manage my accounts online whenever possible but every now and then I do need to go into the bank for a transaction of some sort.  When I do go in, it's usually Eddie at this location that I work with.  He's very professional and takes care of business for us - no problem. 

It's interesting because my husband's work and personal bank accounts are at another bank with a branch just down the street from this one.  He loves his bank, but I somehow convinced him to keep our shared account at BofA.  I've had to go to his bank for some transactions as well, and I see why he is loyal to them; it's a friendlier atmosphere over there.

Nonetheless, I'm still a loyal BofA customer and can't complain about their services at all.  I wish I could say that I'm making a ton of money on the interest I'm earning with my BofA accounts, but I'm not.  I'm not losing money either though.  So if you're looking for a reliable bank with a convenient location in the Old Town area, this may be for you.","review","fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw",7,2,6,"Bank of America",6,4.5,"AZ","4020 N Scottsdale Rd Ste 103

They discouraged me from taking one of those evil ARMs, which would have gotten me a lot more house, but also would have lead to me eventually becoming one of those people on the news. 

The whole process was quick and relatively painless, and they were accessible for the lawyers and brokers and all who were involved with the purchase of my home. It took some finagling, also, as my house was a HUD home, so there was all kinds of special paperwork involved in the process. In the end, though, I got my mortgage and got all my paperwork on time to meet the HUD people's quirky red tape.

Any of you (including you, BOA) can reach me at joltin@aol.com (please subject any emails, ""BOA ISSUE"" or I may not see). BOA, its people and these kind of systems are deliberately engineering the US economy to take money away from those who can least afford it. 

FIGHT BACK!!

-------------------

OMG!!!

What a ripoff!!!! They systematically steal our money in the form of government handouts and then, because they need more to fund their crooked system, come at us all individually. This is bold-faced theft and the individuals involved should really be criminally charged - yes Tara Tatro - this includes you!

Anyone know a good attorney?--seems like we might have enough for a class action. 

MICHAEL  MOORE - GOT A SUBJECT FOR YOU!!! 

My background: 
I had a $7,000 credit limit w BOA and have had zero late payments on my account for at least 2 years. During the last year I maintained a higher balance-  in the$ 6,000 area. As I've moved into cleaning up my finances, I paid off BOA. IMMEDIATELY, they lowered my credit line a crazy amount. Not to $5,000, not $3000 but to $500 dollars in July 2009 - a 93% credit line decrease!!! How can  you even pretend to justify this? In the end, they claimed that they re-reviewed my credit and this is what they came up with - despite my always paying on time. Keep in mind, my credit has had NO new negative entries in over two years!!!

What does this mean ?- It means BOA was happy has a cow to charge my 20+% interest on a 6,000 balance (about $250 per month) but then once I paid it down -restrict my access to the charge card.  WAIT A MINUTE!!! So if you accept I paid them this interest for a year, they've stolen $3,000 from me and now won't let me ( a proven paying customer) charge anything anymore. AND because they've lowered my credit line, they've lowered my credit utilization percentage and hence my further access to the credit market - think home purchase.

Can you see how they trap you?

So, I call Customer Service to complain... their response? ""Tough""... argh.... Next step, I go visit a branch to have this explained to me. The branch GM is very nice, researches it with his resources and comes back with the answer that he is sorry but doesn't know how this happened or the rationale. He asks me to let him know what I find out. 

Double ARGH!!!!! Think about that, the branch manager is asking me to figure out what's going on with this thieving company!!!

So, then I call the corporate offices in Charlotte and ask to speak to the VP of Customer Relations. The operator informs me that they can't put any callers through to any executives. Given we (taxpayers) just gave them how many zillion, this seems very strange to me I tell her. The operator is very nice says that she understood but she is systemically prevented from transferring a call or giving out a phone # for executives. 

WOW!! Its like Bank Of Darth Vader - isn't it?

So, then I try this executive customer service line (704-386-5687 - thank you Consumerist!!!). I initially get a very nice lady named Melanie who promises me that they'll be able to fix the situation. She then transfers me to a Tara Tatro (she sounds very young and is quick with the insults). When I ask her title, she tells me her title is ""works in the Office of the Chairman  & CEO"" and refuses to give me any more info.  (BTW, Did you know this exec customer service department is Tampa? Why does Ken Lewis need to have an office that reports directly to him in Tampa - Winter home???)

She looks into my file and comes back with the same answer - tough. She tells me she found something on my credit report that was late. I challenge her on this because I monitor my reports and I have a 700 score. I ask her what specifically she sees - she won't tell me. She then asks me what credit report I am looking at - I don't tell her, but ask her which one she is looking. Again she won't respond - kinda odd, particularly since my main bank just saw fit to give me a $15k unsecured line of credit - don't you think?

I mean seriously - these guys take zillions of $$s out of the economy so they can line their pockets with fat bonuses, extra homes and country club memberships.  And they cant be made available to anyone? 

I point out that this kind of extortion is exactly what's put them in hot water with congress and the American public and how I really didn't understand the timing of their decision to reduce my credit limit. Whatever motivated them COULD NOT have happened during the month they lowered my scores, because I subscribe to the credit monitoring services.
WAKE UP EVERYONE!!! - THEY ARE STEALING FROM US ALL AND, AS THEY SAY, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!
Please don't fall into the vicious trap I did. They don't treat rich people this way.","review","-DjV8WiZwB4PhKR1ily09Q",0,0,1,"Bank of America",3,3,"NC","508 S Kings Dr

Plenty of staff at around Monday 2pm when walking in. They moved the line really fast with 4 tellers and an information booth guy to help direct you.

They even have a couple computers for customers to use for accessing their online accounts.

We had gone to the branch at Stephanie and Sunset first, as it is closer to where we were, but the banker kept telling my mom that she had to call someone first. He had decided to not listen to my mom, that he knew better about the situation, and sent us away. So we left and went to another branch 10 minutes down the road, where they were able to get us in and out in 15 minutes, WITHOUT HAVING TO CALL ANYONE ON THE PHONE. Had the first branch had better customer service and actually listened to the customer, rather than assume that they knew better than the customer (perhaps because she speaks English with an accent?), we might have saved an hour of hour time.

He was helpful, easy going, professional and gave me some advice about accounts for my teens that was actually helpful. Then he introduced me to their manager and that was cool to.  First class in my book.  I wasn't worried about ""being sold"" to open more accounts as I would do it online anyway and it does not cost anything extra... Great service.

b.  Location - Right on Eastern and St. Rose Parkway. Easy in and out, outdoor tellers and also two outside ATM and inside as well.

c.  ATM - If you take over 100 from the ATM, you might get some 50's with it.  If you go to the ATM inside the bank, you generally get 20's only.

Overall, I liked the service and the friendliness. I was on verge of leaving WFB for the exact reasons I like this one.  I felt anonymous, and indifferent.  Today, the experience here was great.","review","HOaWRV72ZQs0me1geSqBzg",1,1,4,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,3,"NV","10010 S Eastern Ave

The one time I had to go in to deposit a check and pull out extra cash for rent, the line was not too long and moved quickly (think it was a Wednesday around noon) . Staff was pleasant to interact with, just the way they were trained to do by corporate or the branch manager.

Plenty of parking spaces whenever I am here.  So I would say this is a good branch for customers that mainly utilizes ATM to conduct their WF transactions, with the occasional in-branch visit.

Getting out of the parking lot to head North on Jones can be a pain, if you are there during peak traffic hours.  In which case try to use the center turning lane, and Frogger your way over as needed. Just be careful of north-bound vehicles that want to turn left onto Spring Mountain Rd.

I had $200 in cash. What I wanted was $100 to go toward my credit card and to exchange the other $100 bill for $20s. Sounds simple enough, right? Apparently not! The teller (wish I remembered her name) took the first $100 bill, processed the payment and printed out the receipt. Then, another employee comes up to her and asks if she saw a cashier's check ""lying around somewhere."" She looks around her area and tells him no. Then she takes my other $100 bill, puts it in her drawer and asks ""is there anything else I can help you with?""
Me: ""Ummm, I'm waiting for my $20 bills for the other $100 bill I gave you....""
Her: ""Didn't you only give me a $100?""
Me: ""No, I gave you two $100 bills.""
Her: ""Did you really?""

So she calls her manager over and tells her what happened. Then she said ""I got distracted because ______ interrupted me and asked me a question."" The manager tells her to count her drawer. Just great. So I have to stand there waiting for another 10 minutes because she didn't do her job. BS I tell you! When she was done, she laughed and said ""Oh, you were right."" Duh!!

I consider this bank my home bank. I tend to gravitate here most, between all of the Wells Fargo spread across the valley, its my favorite. 
Sometimes there is a water bottle cooler, like that and most of all on Friday they have fresh cookies, why? I guess to keep customers like me happy. You can go to the normal personal line, merchant teller, or drive thru.  I always like going into the wells Fargo, the people  are very nice and that makes me feel good about giving the bank money.  
Thanks for keeping a speedy line when I'm in a rush and allowing me to deposit my checks minutes before you close.

Happy banking,
Kevin","review","0qIsBt4EzBDCKrIviV55Ew",2,4,3,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,2.5,"AZ","3002 N Central Ave

Wells Fargo
Attn: Branch Manager
3002 N Central Ave
Phoenix, AZ, 85012

To Whom it May Concern,

I understand the customer is NOT always right. I understand that I am not now, nor will I ever be your best, most profitable customer. I don't make a lot of money, I am living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet. I am trying to get back on my feet to where I can live without floating one bill to pay another. I have a Second Chance account and I am trying to do the best so I can transition to a regular account. But none of this means your employees have the right to treat me like a second class citizen. You have to understand that in customer service, when a customer has a good experience, they tell one to two people. When the customer has a great experience they tell 3 to 4 people. On the opposite end of the spectrum. When a customer has a bad experience, they tell 10 to 12 people and when they have a horrible experience, they take to social media where they are visible to hundreds or even thousands of people. 
I am a relatively new customer to Wells Fargo. Since opening my accounts, I have been in several times for various transactions, usually depositing a paycheck (which are now direct deposited), and have really always received world-class service from your employees from the moment I would walk in, to the moment I left.
Yesterday was a completely different story. I will start by apologizing, as I was out of line at the end of the transaction. I drove off and flipped the teller off. I strongly feel though, that my actions at the END of this transaction do NOT validate your employees' treatment of me at the BEGINNING of the transaction. I was in a great mood because I finally received my tuition assistance check for $3669.00 from Arizona State University where I am a student. I rushed over to make it to your branch before they closed. I went through the drive through, only wanting to deposit this check. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes. The teller never apologized for the wait or explained what the hold up was, she just left us waiting. I am still in a great mood at this point though. Finally she comes back and advises simply that my check is being held. I ask why and until what date. This is when the conversation goes downhill. She tells me it is on hold until Tuesday because I have a Second Chance Bank Account and the check is from Bank of America and if I don't like that, I can go next door to Bank of America. 
Are you kidding me? Her first reaction is to tell me to take my business elsewhere?? Who does that?? She was so condescending and rude I was shocked. But I let it go and collected my ID, debit card and receipt. I noticed the receipt read the deposit was $3669 and that $3469 was being held. I pressed the call button and asked the teller about the $200 difference. She was clearly irritated with me at that point and tells me the entire amount is on hold as it clearly states on my receipt. I tell her its not clear on my receipt, that's why I am asking. She responds by telling me she is going to get her manager. What? Are you serious? Up to now, I have not talked back to her, I have not raised my voice, I have been completely respectful. The manager comes over. I try asking my questions again and she cuts me off saying as it clearly states on your receipt sir, the entire amount is being held. I say again, its not clear on my receipt. She again cuts me off and tells me its clear on my receipt. She cut me off and repeated herself 3 times. I was so furious I drove off and that is when I flipped her off. Again my apologies, but again, this does not validate how I was treated. I went into the branch as soon as they opened this morning and spoke with a manager. As soon as I told her I had gone through the drive through last night, she stopped me and said oh, ""you're the guy that flipped off my employees?"" and proceeds to lecture me as though I am a child and basically threatened to kick me out of the branch. Again, I had not raised my voice this entire time. She finally lets me explain what happened, and though she is verbally apologetic, it is clear she could absolutely care less. In fact, several times, she kept saying I don't know why they would have talked to you like that, I don't know what the circumstances were. There were no circumstances that I should have EVER been treated like that. Yes I flipped them off, but that was at the very end of the transaction as I was driving away. The manager never asked for my name or phone number, never said she would get back to me if she has other questions. She was just giving me lip service, and barely made any real effort at that.
Normally I can forgive and forget, but these two interactions from three employees are unforgivable and I am now questioning my loyalty as a customer.
What reason do I have to stay?

Sincerely,

Lucas R.","review","esomNneHvsEv91MmraM5ug",1,2,2,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,2.5,"AZ","3002 N Central Ave

I went into the bank expecting a problem but it is very easy.

Not too bad - the companies involved stopped the charges or refunded the money that had already been taken. But I did cancel my debit card and visit my nearby branch. I entered with two out of state checking accounts, a recent large deposit, and a barely used checking account. The various tellers have been asking me for 8 years if I wanted to change to an Arizona account, but I was too lazy.

I was helped this afternoon by the senior personal banker, Monica L. She was incredible. Very personable, patient, and helpful. She explained everything, made recommendations, and helped me put my accounts in the best position to work for me. I came away with an Arizona checking account and a money market account. The two out of state accounts will be transitioned out once the fraud charges have been restored. 

She made a challenging situation more manageable and I came away with a better line of services than I entered with. I have been a BOA customer for 8 years, but rarely use their services other than online.

The following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. 

Going through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. 

I called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious???

I found that Wells Fargo Bank seemed to be best for me and my needs. 

The person there at this location, whom I was referred to, was very helpful and patient with the many questions that I had. His name is Joseph Giustino. 

It seems as if now a days banks are in love with charging their customers FEES, FEES, FEES! With the account that I had opened, there are NO monthly maintenance fees. This is very refreshing, being that the FCU that I have back in Honolulu has none, as well. On the other hand, another bank that I had visited here in Vegas, wanted to charge a monthly fee of $12! What in the world?!

I opened a new business account (I recently moved to Las Vegas) and was told that problems might arise in the first 3 months but I was not to worry about fees, ect., because these are to be expected.
First of all, I had a check get lost in the mail so I cancelled it. 3 weeks later it shows up to the branch and it gets bounced back... as it should have. Then I deposited a check at the branch and the next week cancelled that bank account (this was my fault... I jumped the gun - not even realizing the check was still out there...
I went to use my Wells Fargo card and it got declined. I called customer service (misinformation and no real help) and then I went into the branch and was told that they had cancelled all of my cards and closed my accounts.
""Loss Prevention"" said that I could not get my money out of my account for 2 weeks. When I called Loss Prevention I was greeted with a robot voiced woman that answered with ""Nope"" and ""Yep""... I asked if there was anything I could do to straighten this out and her answer was ""nope"". I asked if I could speak to a supervisor and she said I could but it wouldn't make any difference... I asked if I could get access to the $20K in my account and she said ""Nope. Not for 10 business days"". (Keep in mind I never overdrew my account).

Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

If you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us.

This BAC branch is nearest to my home.  It is convenient so you'd think I would go in there most often when I need to do more than use the ATM.  WRONG!  Over the past few years the customer service has been a reflection of a string of branch managers who didn't seem appropriate to be in that position. I will share two examples with you.   One made you just not want to go in there, period, due to the charm she did not exude.   Another was nice enough but didn't seem to be really capable of doing the job. There other employees had to work with these people and some of them came with them it seemed, which made it worse.  I hold my bank to a higher standard as it is handling my money for me.  As a result, I guess I have higher expectations when I walk in the door as opposed to other businesses.

Today, I either left my wallet at a restaurant that was closed before I could get back there lost it, or had it stolen.  When I discovered this, I realized that if I was going to get there before closing, I had to got to 20th St and Camelback.  If I hadn't felt I should have a temporary debit card to use in case of an emergency, I would have waited until the next day and gone else where.  Before I walked in the door, I reminded myself that as usual I'd better expect a long wait as was the case for even the most minor of things at this branch, among other things.

It was a relief when a young gentleman, Christ Berry, a personal banker, who seemed to be better capable of giving customer service in the past was available to help me.  As we went through the process of doing what was necessary, Chris actually seemed happy and relaxed in what he was doing.  Another personal banker whose name I don't know was actually smiling when she came over to get something next to where I was sitting.  I finally told Chris that I usually dreaded coming in that branch because of the attitude that usually prevailed and how long things always took.  He asked me how long since I'd been in and went on to tell me that they had a new manager.   She'd been making some changes and customers seemed happy about it.  I couldn't argue.  He said he'd to like me to meet the new manager who turned out to be an assistant from one of the branches that I'd much prefer to go to.  Her name is Shaleen Scott who has been promoted from assistant at one of the branches I much prefer to go to.  She even recognized me even though we hadn't had that much actual personal contact.  She straightened out a problem caused by the bank itself one day and couldn't have been more gracious in the way she did it, one day so I recognized her immediately.  she also was pleasant enough to always take a moment to say hello when she say me in the future. 

The moral of the story is this.  It is a pretty safe to say if you aren't happy with your branch, try this one.  I'll be going back.  When it involves my finances, this is the kind of attitude I like to see.  After they closed the branch in Fry's across the street I was bummed  For as small as it was, I always felt appreciated there and could get things done promptly.   I felt this same attitude today so guess I can start using this branch again regularly.  What a relief!  Minor plus to all of this.  With the cost of gas, closer is always better!","review","4sIK_74UwkKU9YQXIfgCdg",1,0,0,"Bank of America",5,3.5,"AZ","1950 E Camelback Road

"vypbBexHcr-5k4l8LQIF6w","2012-09-11","e8_HHOWA4UXgy1YIt0YKgQ",4,"Who would EVER think that breaking up with a bank, ESPECIALLY Bank of America (whom everyone knows I HATE!!!!), would be so bittersweet? I have opened accounts at local banks (Arizona State Credit Union and National Bank of Arizona) to shift as much of my business as possible to local businesses.

Bank of America was just like that girlfriend (or boyfriend....trying to be equal opportunity here) who would NOT accept that it was over and move on. Trying to close my accounts was like pulling teeth. 

I sent a letter to the branch in California where I opened the account (because no one can seem to do anything ever if it's an out-of-state account) requesting the account be closed,. That letter was completely ignored. I then sent another letter (per the website instructions) to an address back  east again requesting closure of the account and pointing out that my last letter was ignored and not onset to the proper entity.

I received a letter with a form that needed to be notarized and sent back east to close the account. Or I could go to any Bank of America location for assistance. I chose the latter and walked into this location expecting to be told they couldn't help me and preparing to have a few choice words with the bank manager.

Instead I was greeted by the sweetest customer service associate, called Brianna. She was very helpful and efficient and did attempt to retain me as a customer. From our brief conversation she offered products and solutions to meet my financial needs and really put forth the warmest most genuine effort I have EVER experienced from a bank to deliver good service, look after me as a customer and retain my business.

My experience with her really made me second guess my choice to leave Bank of America because I felt so looked after and cared about. Unfortunately, especially at Bank of America, for every one of Brianna, there are about 1,000 associates who are incompetent, could care less, have rotten attitudes or all of the above.  So it was with that thought that I followed through.

I do have to say that  I have been impressed with other associates at this particular branch in the past. I recall a teller who had to deal with a rotten bitch of customer who was utterly rude and condescending. Without raising her voice or losing her cool, the teller gave that attitude RIGHT back to her. Unfortunately in customer service, killing customers with kindness sometimes invites more abuse so the best route may be to give it right back to an unreasonable person. This was one of those case and that teller handled it perfectly in my opinion. 

Needless to say, the bitch complained to the manager but after I concluded my business I went to the manager and told her how rotten that woman was and that the teller had, in my opinion, acted completely appropriately.

So this branch really stands out as best as it possibly can for Bank of America. It is still plagued long lines and waits which is frustrating but the service here has been noteworthy more than once for me.

I still believe firmly in supporting local business so I am happy with my decision to leave but for an institution which has demonstrated an consistent record of poor, impersonable service, this branch is a gem and I would recommend it to any Bank of American customers.

As for Brianna, she should be promoted to head of customer service because she could really make a difference I think in improving customer service at Bank of America. Her warmth and personality and caring nature make her better suited to a local bank.","review","wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow",6,6,6,"Bank of America",5,3.5,"AZ","1950 E Camelback Road

I remember hearing that Wells Fargo did this for free if you have a certain account.  I walked into the branch and let them know what kind of checking account I had and they let me know that they notorize for free for all account holders. I sat and waited for the the associate to come get me.  I only waited for a few minutes.  I sat next to a kid who looked like he was getting ready to be interviewed.  I was then greeted by the Well Fargo associate and went to his office space.  His name was Paulo and he was a financial advisor for Wells Fargo.  He was very friendly.  I was happy that I didn't run into anyone that looked like they hated their job at this branch.  We had a long conversation which was great.

I stated maybe not stand around with 2 other employees at the entrance and not even making conversation with people in line. Maybe some people could be helped thru the atm.

We walked into this bank and it was fairly empty we were told to have a seat to replace a debit card but this turned into a nightmare for my girlfriend. We waited at least an hour for a replacement card as we watch a customer walk out crying for what we only guess maybe they were declined a mortgage or something but the young lady was in tears. Then the service agent that was suppose to help us was having a merry good time talking and laughing with someone he was helping instead for realizing there was someone waiting he continued on at this point my girlfriend head was going to explode. So finally the representative finish and it appeared that they were done but he went outside with her to carry on another conversation for another 5 minutes. At this point her head was growing at an enormous rate so she asked him if they were done and could he help her but his reply was that he had someone else to handle and it would be at least another 10 minutes.  

Overall the customer service is horrible and it odd because this particular bank charges a fee to deal with anyone that's human so you would think they would be more accustom to handling those people that are charged a fee to keep them working a little better. 

I told my girlfriend maybe it's time to switch her bank to one that respects a person who keep there money with them. 

Avoid this bank like the plague unless you have some free time to sit on their horrible red crushed velvet chairs.","review","hlyF0wC2NFSKQd1aHapQfQ",0,0,0,"Bank of America",9,2.5,"NV","641 Mall Ring Cir

I've been really happy with the switch. In fact, I kinda' love it. They have a super easy to navigate app that sends me instant updates on all my purchases. It's really easy to keep track of where my money is going. They have tons of branches across the US and that's super convenient since I travel a lot. I always receive great service and decided to use them for all my banking/financial needs. 

I come to this branch pretty often to make deposits and get my banking business squared away. It's right in my neighborhood  in an ultra convenient location in the local shopping center (hello.. Babystacks) . The tellers here are super friendly and efficient. The drive thru has multiple lanes to choose from and they rarely have a line for their ATMs. I'm always greeted with a smile and they're always helpful.

Tops for me is one person ahead of me. Customer service is friendly. Although there's no one to greet you in and ask you what you need help with. It's whatever though. The location really sucks. It sucks for big vehicles. The lot is small and overpacked due to the other businesses in the plaza. As for their Drive thru ATMs, it's like any other drive thru ATM. People don't know what they want to do and hold up a lot of cars which makes the parking lot even more pack.

And I hate to tell you, Banks, but your customers have every right to demand damn near perfect service when they hand you their hard-earned money and expect to be able to transfer, store, and withdraw it without an issue.  Sometimes emotions run rampant because it's MONEY and it's a touchy subject period but if you can't take the heat get OUT of the kitchen.  

So that said - I had nothing but good experiences dealing with the ATMs and drive-thru at this location.  But the one and ONLY time I step foot into the bank - that's when the issues started.  Not one, not two, but three miserable problems in one visit.

So at the time I visited, about 3/4pm with my partner in crime in tow, we came for two different reasons - he wanted to talk to them about closing an account, I wanted to withdraw money as well as convert Japanese Yen into American Dollars.  

I asked the manager at the center console and she directs us to stand in line - that ""they can take care of all of that.""

We wait fifteen minutes, finally get to a teller who, after I mentioned I need to convert Yen, directs me to sit and wait to talk to a manager.  We sit, wait ten minutes, a manager then walks over and asks us what we were waiting for.  I tell her what we wanted.  She vanishes, then states that they only do conversions until TWO PM.  (What?)  I then mentioned the other two things we want to do and she directs us to a teller - to GET BACK IN LINE and wait another fifteen/twenty minutes to do what we originally waited in line and wanted to do!  

When I asked her why the staff had me get out of line and wanted me to wait TWICE and made me wait forty minutes for nothing for a policy that was listed NOWHERE within sight, she stated that she recently transferred from another state and the policies were different.  

NO APOLOGY.  No accepting responsibility.  None of that.  Simply, ""I didn't know.  Get back in line.""  

A completely lack of respect for a customer who gives you his hard-earned money to hold and a lack of his time!  

The manager on Rainbow and Cheyenne apologized on her behalf and they took care of us in twenty. minutes. flat.  Take that, Rancho and Craig!","review","MpUfVh-leP_otTrYpseaXA",2,2,2,"Bank of America",4,3,"NV","4361 N Rancho Drive

I made the mistake of  using Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

If you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us. 

If I could go back, I would have gone to a federal credit union for my mortgage.","review","nBqU_AHXCayr3BQWzfyB5A",1,0,5,"Chase Bank",5,3,"AZ","5041 N 16th St

It's only in the past year that I've begun to question how much longer I'll continue to do so. Especially since I have accounts at a few other financial institutions and I haven't had any problems with those businesses.

My experience inside this branch was so-so. I stood in a long line and made my deposit at a teller station that was too close to the line and too close to the other teller stations for any privacy that may be required during a bank transaction.

But I think I can say that about every Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) location that I've ever been in. 

My teller greeted me professionally enough, helped me complete my transaction, bid me farewell, and wished me a good weekend. (It was a Friday.)

Later in the evening, I was surprised to get an e-mail notification about my deposit AND my withdrawal. 

I immediately checked my account online and sure enough, there was a line that said I had made a withdrawal in a branch or store. Which I knew I had NOT. And why would I, when I had deposited CASH? (The money was withdrawn at the same branch I made my deposit which is why I am writing the review under this branch. I have another issue that happened at another branch that I will review under that branch.)

I called the 24-hour customer service line, explained the situation and was told that the customer service rep had had a similar call earlier.

She then asked me if I knew someone named A______ M_______. (I do not. And even if I did, how would A_______ M_______ withdraw from my account if she is not a joint account holder?)

Suspicious to say the least.

While I cannot say for sure that my teller was at fault for this mishap, she was the person who accessed my information. Is it possible that she didn't close out my file when my transaction was completed, allowing further access to my account?

They wouldn't divulge that information which I can understand but don't appreciate.

It took the bank a week to investigate and return the funds to my account.

Thankfully there were no overdrafts due to this unpleasant occurrence.


Note: This branch is now a Wells Fargo Bank, like the all the former Wachovia Banks here in Charlotte.","review","oTZ2SuhCU0NvhoctjCRtiw",0,0,0,"Wells Fargo Bank",4,2.5,"NC","1616 Central Ave

I understand why they did not help. It wasn't that they could not. It was at the (acting) manager's discretion, as explained to me by Wells Fargo customer service when I called their toll free number.

What I can't appreciate is the manner in which the (acting) manager chose not to help, which included lying about ""federal regulations"", refusing to honor checks written on a Wells Fargo account by a government agency, and refusing to honor documentation from the Mecklenburg county courthouse.

The customer service I received at this branch was the proverbial straw.

I decided a few years ago to open a BofA checking account as a secondary account in case I ever had issues with my Chase account.  Being that it was a secondary account, I did not look at it often.  To my surprise, BofA changed the terms of their accounts and the new terms stated that my account now required a higher minimum balance.  I did not even know about this until I logged in online and saw a string of monthly fees because my account did not meet their new minimum.  Great job BofA.  Even after calling BofA and telling them my issue, they would not budge.

Well, thank you, Bank of America, for a lovely morning.

First, your online system completely failed when trying to open an account (the usefulness of an error message that reads ""Check and fix errors to continue"" and then fails to actually IDENTIFY any errors on the screen perhaps speaks for itself).

Then, there's the 40 minutes my wife and I just spent on the phone trying to open an account with you that have changed my desire to ever do business with you again. Your telephone application process by itself is needlessly repetitive (you really have to ask for my telephone number, address, and social security number THREE different times, and then ask my wife for her address and telephone number at least two other times even though she's already verified that we live in the same place?). And the fact that we had to spend 10 of the 40 minutes on hold because you apparently forced your representative to reset his password IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR APPLICATION PROCESS really didn't help.

But really, the fact that you'd pull a credit report and then require us to answer the birth month of an extended-family relative, and then tell us to GUESS when we say that we don't have any idea, even though you acknowledge that an incorrect guess may cause a rejection of the application? Why exactly would we do that? Why would your rep's supervisor even suggest such a thing would be appropriate? Is that really your company's policy?

So, yes, we're not opening a new account with you. And frankly, we may be pulling our existing accounts.","review","SLTTFfO-kz1vXYZsbXDtxQ",0,0,0,"Bank of America",3,1,"NC","100 N Tryon St

I phoned customer service to make sure my daily withdrawl limit was sufficient as I was playing in a large buyin tournament at the WSOP (I play poker professionally).  Customer service assured me it would be no problem and that I could make the withdrawl at any branch.

I came into the branch and the teller got the plump blonde manager over to approve the transaction (I had plenty of cash in my acct to cover it, nothing pending) and she simply wouldn't approve the transaction.  More than that she wouldn't give me any reason why.  WTF???

Remaining calm, I contacted support again.  They said I should be able to make the withdrawl, and they asked to speak to the branch manager.  The teller refused to touch my phone, and said there was no phone number support could reach them at, and they could not call out.  Comical.  The support agent on the phone laughed at the fact that the branch wouldn't talk to her and apologized to me.

Worse yet, the blonde manager remained in her office too busy eating or something to come out and address the issue.  I never raised my voice or acted unprofessionally towards anyone.

I missed the tournament thanks to this absurdity at B of A.  The branch manager or manager on duty (chubby blonde girl) should seriously be fired.

I walked in and the person at the front who greets the customers stayed on the phone the entire time while I was waiting to be seen by either a teller or a personal banker which ever one could solve my problem.  I waited for him to finish up his phone call, during that period of time he was joking and laughing with the person on the phone and not talking business,  so right away I could tell that this is going to be a waste of time. I should've walked out right there but I was stupid and stayed around.

Next I was seated with a personal banker who had a dual appointment with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.

I gave him my ATM card and asked that he look up my accounts. I have three checking accounts with Bank of America and one savings.  I wanted to see if there was a way I could still keep one of my smaller checking account even though I wasn't going to have a minimum $1500 in that account at all times.  I was experiencing an $18 per month fee which would basically make the account pointless because I was going to be paying more in fees than I was getting out of it.  I keep that checkbook in my bag to pay simple league fees for shooting.  Even though it's been years since I was in college, Bank of America made simple modifications in the past and changed this small account over to campus edge checking.  I find out it has done away with that now because they just want more fees.  Don't make enough money and they want to squeeze their customers more?

The only thing that this guy wanted to do was help me move my brokerage accounts and my profit-sharing and 401(k) over from Wells Fargo. I told him that I just wanted to avoid the $18 per month checking account fee on this 16 year old account THEN he had to get up and go talk to a branch manager. He came back he said that he and the branch manager talked about it because I don't have direct deposit or the minimum amount that they wanted that there was no way that they can help me.  It was basically ridiculous and Bank of America sucks for charging continuous fees for a customer that they have had since the 1990s.  If it wasn't so much trouble for me to change banks I would do it then I'd have to figure out a way to notify all of the companies that I have making automatic debits from my other checking accounts.  I'm half tempted to do it if this keeps up I think I will.","review","pjOmnrRyQyp7dxH00yRNCw",0,0,0,"Bank of America",8,4,"NV","4080 Spring Mountain Road

She helped my girlfriend and I set up her bank account (she's German), and Sorina was SO helpful in the whole process. She's also a notary in Illinois and notarized a couple of things we needed while we were at her desk. 

Seriously, I almost never think of a bank as ""my bank""... I usually pick which ever one is closest at the time, but because of Sorina, I will absolutely go to this bank anytime I have to do anything more than just withdraw or deposit. All thanks to Sorina always being helpful, even recognizing us when we come in and coming over to ask how we are doing or if we need anything! Just wonderful customer service. Thank you Sorina!","review","XDxUN0fFwbJr4tTQgeLbKQ",2,1,2,"Bank of America",5,3.5,"NV","2451 S Fort Apache Rd

They are very friendly and professional, I always feel at home here. Scott's the teller supervisor, and he's very reasonable and attentive to customer's when there's a problem, and they always have great tellers on-board. I hope this bank never changes!","review","u9dVWjLiddkScHuvZOeq2w",0,0,0,"Bank of America",3,2.5,"AZ","63 W Main Street

I have gotten to know the employees on a first name basis and had felt very satisfied with the service.  The last few months at this branch have been a disaster! The drive thru will be closed although the posted sign says open.  The line in the branch are routinely 8 deep in customers and the wait is at least 15 min. What persuaded me to write this review is last week I went into the branch to make a deposit.  The manager informed me there would be a 25 minute wait.  I communicated that the service at the branch had deteriorated.  He said the service was still good but that the wait was just longer.  HELLO!  He suggested I make the deposit at the ATM. He said the bank is in transitioning into more on-line banking.  I left and drove a couple of miles to Stapley and Main branch.  Was in and out in 5 min.  Not going back to Main and Mcdonald.","review","ZMlbCacaYOmoRjpaqah6oQ",0,0,0,"Bank of America",3,2.5,"AZ","63 W Main Street
