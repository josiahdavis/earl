Their choco-banana and other chocolate desserts are all rich, smooth, and tasty!! 

Not to mention, their freshly baked ham & cheese croissants melt in your mouth.  Full of buttery, flaky goodness!  Yummm!!  We didn't realize how good they were, and wished we had bought two!

Matt at Sutra Midtown Yoga (next door to Drip) let them know we'd be over afterwards and they had tables and chairs pulled together in the semi private space in the north part of their place.

Gina is dynamic and attentive, and the food was was especially enjoyable. Matt had talked up the NY egg sandwich and it didn't disappoint- I had mine with an over hard egg, Boar's Head bacon and tomato. The home fries were some of the best I've had.

I originally tried this place out because I got some coupons on the back of my Schnucks receipt (medium espresso or chai drink for $1.85/$2 off a sandwich or salad).

I've become a slave to Starbucks over the past few years because there simply weren't any good local cafes where I lived (unless I felt like driving 30 miles away).  Cafe Kopi is exactly what I want from a cafe, and I'm happy to finally have a local coffee shop that is actually worth supporting.

Their coffee drinks are tasty, and their chai tastes like it's freshly brewed (though I can't be sure if they actually use a mix...I'll probably ask because I'm really curious).  I tried the Matty Pooh Pita today with honey chipotle pasta salad on the side and it was delicious (also, the plating was beautiful!).  I thought the pasta salad might be weird, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be pretty awesome.  The pita was served open-faced, with tons of hummus and sliced tomato, cucumber, and lettuce.  The hummus to veggie ratio was a little lopsided--I would have appreciated more veggies--but nonetheless it was a damn good meal.  Plus there were a couple tasty pieces of fruit on the side as garnish, which I happily devoured.

Food and drink aside, Cafe Kopi is just a great place to hang out.  My boyfriend and I like to play games (Scrabble, Sumoku, UNO...etc) and there is PLENTY of seating with tables of various sizes.  The atmosphere is cozy and it's just a lovely place to spend some time.

Music selection is kind of weird (whiny sounding hipster music?  not sure how to describe it) but it's not too loud, so it's easy to tune out.

Basically: I really like this place.  If I didn't have to pay for metered parking mon-fri I would probably be here everyday.","review","kltu5MyodHXondt_qvdAHw",0,0,1,"Cafe Kopi","Food,Coffee & Tea",2,10,4,1,13,3,4,10,6,21

So much can change from visit to visit that I always find it a bit presumptuous to assume that a place is 5 stars worth of awesome or 1 star worth of non-awesome based on one measly visit.   And yet one measly visit to the Bronze Cafe, oh, 2 hours ago, and here I am anointing it with 5 stars.   

Enter the Tree of Life.   The Tree of life stars Brad Pitt in a Malick film about the life and the universe.   Yelp/RottenTomatoes Crossover alert!   Okay so this Pita stuffed with veggies and other vegan goodies like a cashew crema and a brazil nut crumble has nothing to do with the movie, but much like I had left the theater after seeing Tree of Life, I had a lot of questions about this Tree of Life after I left Bronze Cafe.   Namely:  was that one of the tastiest pita breads I've ever had? (yes).    Did I really just enjoy a Pita stuffed without any meat products?  (yes).   Did I really just order something called ""Banana Boy Bait""?  (YES)   Well how I really ordered it was I said something along the lines of ""and one of those banana bread things"".    Then the guy who seemed to be running the joint goes ""Banana Boy Bait?!""  to which I looked around sheepishly before saying yes.   It's totally worth any stares you might receive though.   It lasted all of 3 minutes on the table.   I'm not joking when I say I plan to try every sandwich and every Vegan dessert on the menu before my own personal Tree of Life wilts away and has me feasting on dirt and worms.   

Service was friendly, quick and efficient.   The dining area was clean and there wasn't any air of pretentiousness that I think Vegan friendly places can oftentimes be stereotyped with.   In fact it was the complete opposite.

I didn't need to use the restroom so I didn't get to participate in the gender neutrality that it provides.   The thought excites me though because I've heard from some of my female friends that sometimes you all have couches in there sometimes and I'm curious how this translates here.  I've got my fingers crossed for a La-Z-Boy recliner personally.","review","aK8shZb9dEQNyxk5ycfO2A",8,8,8,"Bronze Cafe","Food,Vegetarian,Coffee & Tea,Vegan,Restaurants",6,12,9,5,9,0,5,15,10,18

The decor is clean and inviting. The staff is mostly nice. I've only had one run in where a staff member seemed frazzled but I'll chalk it up to being her first day. The food is not something I'd bank on. I've only had their snacks, so I can't comment on real meals as of yet. But they're all right seeing as the primary focus is the tea.

A variety of drinks are available also as they have a large menu. Try the thai iced tea or the green tea ice cream drink. Both very tasty.

For a Saturday afternoon, I was surprised how busy the place was.  There were only 2 tables open (both with 2 chairs) outside of the study area.  In the study area, there was another seat.  Wow!

The staff (one who assisted me and one who worked the drive through window) made it a point to say hello when I walked up to the counter.  In viewing the sample sized reeses dessert on the counter, I asked if I could try one.  The taste...fantastic.  I asked if any of the coffee beverages came with a free refill, and was advised that none were free, but a refill was only 50 cents, regardless of what size I purchased.  I figured with 45 minutes to wait on the car, I would manage to go through 4 small cups (10 ounce) or 2 large cups (16 ounce), and the initial outlay for the first cup was only 50 cents different, so my best bet was the large cup.  

After I got my cup and added sugar and cream, I looked for a table.  One of the 2-seat tables I saw available had an empty cup and dirty napkins on it.  As I approached, someone from across the room advised the table was taken, so I moved on.  I found another table by the window in a small space next to the study room.  As the table top was sticky, I went back to the counter and asked if I could get a rag to wipe the table down.  Normally, when I have made such a request at other coffee shops, someone would come and wipe down/clean up the table.  This time, I was given a rag and advised to return it when I was done. 

The coffee was respectable.  It was decently hot, and certainly not ""weak"".  Maybe the management wants to consider staffing a third person when it is as busy as it was on Saturday.  Maybe this was an exception...I am just not accustomed to wiping down my table before I sit.","review","8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q",0,0,0,"Xtreme Bean Coffee Co","Food,Coffee & Tea",1,4,2,0,3,0,2,9,4,11
"Qnip6i9Zyd76QZ3X8elWjQ","2011-06-26","6k2fv2V30SaxudJpl_g6Sg",4,"This weekend I was put in charge of finding a Friday night dinner venue for 8 people. Requirements: Hearty food, on a budget + veggie options.

A number of my favourite haunts made the short-list, but in the end I opted for Moo & I'm very glad I did!

Every Friday evening, Moo hold a burger night and it's BYOB (with no corkage fee!). The restaurant advertises the night as running from 6pm 'til 9pm, but on booking, the owner was happy to agree that we could use the venue after this time. Our table reservation was for 8pm and we stayed until just after 10pm. The staff didn't rush us at all & we had an excellent time.

The food:

The burger night portions at Moo are very generous and we were full to the brim on leaving. The menu offers a choice of no-fuss starters (garlic bread, soup, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, coleslaw & salad) and a selection of five main course burger toppings that can be served with a beef, chicken or bean burger. All main courses are served with salad, coleslaw and a portion of seriously tasty hand-cut, homemade chips.

I opted for a chicken burger, topped with bacon & Mull of Kintyre cheddar - it was absolutely delicious. The only disappointment was that the bread was rather ordinary. Tasty rolls from a local Edinburgh bakery would bump my rating up to 5 stars.

The service:

The owners and other staff at Moo are friendly, helpful and attentive. 

Originally, I'd booked our table for 8.30pm, but moved our reservation to 8pm at quite short notice - the restaurant had no issue at all with this.

The Moo website had unfortunately been hacked and the burger menu was unavailable to download (issue now resolved), but within a few minutes of coming off the phone, the owner had emailed a copy to me, so that I could share it with friends.
 
We brought along a selection of prosecco, white wine & red wine (from the wonderful Cornelius on Easter Road) and as Moo charge no corkage fee this made a massive difference to the total bill; a very pocket-friendly ¬£8 per head!

For hearty food on a budget, I highly recommend burger nights at Moo Cafeteria.

Moo can be reached by bus on the #23, #27 and #8 routes and is well-placed for after dinner drinks in Canonmills, Broughton Street & Stockbridge.","review","r45qgallWCKeMJO9d94J3g",0,0,1,"Moo Cafeteria","Food,Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants",4,9,1,3,14,3,1,16,6,26

This place got the job done in splendid fashion and I only wish I could have stayed longer, as the place had a vibe all at once cozy and inviting. Hailed as the best coffee shop on the South Side of Pittsburgh, I was excited to test the claim and did so with a Cadbury Creme Egg Latte.

The drink was beyond good. There was no creme egg mixed in - it was simply a concoction of flavors set to mimick the taste of one, combined with strong, rich coffee. My girlfriend and I were blown away. I remember her remarking, ""Can't you taste the difference? Of this versus a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts?"" And I had to admit that yes, this was good coffee, full of natural flavors and with premium ingredients.

We walked around the place and the decor was cute. Very old school, with a blackboard and chalk to note the day's selections and lots of colors and funky props. Even a mini chandelier above the display cases!

They had soups, pies, cookies, breads, pastry, gelato. Everything looked tasty. There was also outdoor seating available.

Sadly, we were at the end of the trip and only got the lattes. Next time we are back in town, we'll stay longer and sample the baked goods.

Reasons for subtracting a star are pretty much due to not having enough exposure to give this place an ""all-time best"" recommend and also problems with parking (tiny lot, very little street parking). Certainly the coffee was great and our barista was friendly and knowledgeable.

When we're in town visiting I always leave our son with Grandma for an hour or so to visit Wine at the Pines. I first learned about WP when my mom mentioned that there was a place opening up in town that was going to be serving Metropolis Coffee. 
For those of you who are not familiar with Metropolis, it's the best coffee ever! We live in Chicago just down the block from the Metropolis mothership and there isn't a better cappuccino to be had anywhere. They import and roast their own beans and do it so well that they were rated the best coffee shop in Chicago. Whole Foods has started selling their coffee as well. 
But I digress. 
Aside from the coffee at WP you can browse their wine cellar, have a sandwich, sample good cheeses and pasta or gorge yourself on baked goods like I'm doing right now.
In the front of the cafe there are a few tables and chairs and two bars. In the back there's some more tables and some comfy-looking leather chairs.
My only criticism is that I would like for them to be open earlier than noon on sundays.","review","EF6JymlENkybJjzi6TsjoQ",1,0,1,"Wines At the Pines","Food,Wine Bars,Coffee & Tea,Bars,Nightlife",1,2,1,0,2,2,2,2,5,6

The dumplings are as big as a pizza pocket but made with eggs, green onion and shrimp. Two for $5 is the perfect price.

Service was super nice and I liked how we were introduced to all employees when we first walked in. They were all ready to help and answer any questions we may have.

I will admit my drink is a little on the complicated side, but usually when I tell other baristas ""my drink is a little complicated"" they don't hold it against me but instead welcome it as a challenge. However this barista was rude about the whole thing. Then when my drink was past to another barista to be made I noticed she didn't use the milk I requested specifically. I realize we all make mistakes, so I politely asked if that was the correct milk. She said, ""yea"" without even double checking the cup to see if maybe she did make a mistake and she continued to make the drink so I just let it slide. Now, my drink is a green tea latt√© and I like it shaken in a shaker very well so there aren't any clumps of green tea, if you shake it very well it will come out perfect. When the barista handed me my drink it looked like she had shaken 3 times. When I asked her if she could shake it anymore to get rid of the green tea clumps she very rudely said ""it doesn't matter how much I shake it, it will still look the same"" I was so disappointed in both of the baristas customer service and quality in which they made our drinks.

Until somewhat recently - namely when I have to make them for the kids - I really prefer them over pancakes by a wide margin.  While you can pull waffles out of the freezer, it is just so much easier (and tastier) to make pancakes from scratch.  Sure, you can make waffles at home, but they are so messy.  And who has time to go to Waffle House every day?  But I digress.

The waffles at Cast Iron are different from just about any other waffle.  However, to have them, you have to find them, and that is a bit of a challenge.  The address does not help much.  It gets you in the area.  Their directions tell you they are ""across from the bank"", but in reality, they are in little shop in the base of a townhome (or that is what it looks like) - while all the other businesses are at the other end of the center.  So you are nowhere near where you would think they should be.  Keep that in mind.

Should you actually find the place, you may find yourself disappointed if you go at the wrong time.  While they sell their waffles to go (so you can enjoy them at home later), apparently if you go outside of busy hours, they actually make waffles during this time even for serving at non-busy hours.  So if you are are there at, say, dinner time - a nice, non-busy time where you might want a waffle for a treat - then you are likely to get a previously made, perhaps refrigerated or frozen waffle rather than a freshly prepared one.  Still tasty, but not great.

And there is not a ton of selection - not that that is a bad thing.  Waffles and some toppings (which you can customize).  Everything else is drinks.  Just so long as you are not expecting a version of the Belgium House of Waffles or the Waffle House of Belgium, you should be fine.  This is more the Belgium Kiosk of Waffles.

First of all, free wireless is always nice, especially when it comes from a quieter, less corporate place like Starbuck's. Always a plus. 

The place itself is, to use the parlance of my girlfriend, super cute. It's quaint and homey, which is just how I like my coffee houses. There's artwork, comfy chairs and couches; it feels like home, which isn't that common in coffee places around here.

The truffle, on the other hand, was alright. It was a pretty small piece (compared with Godiva's truffles). The inside wasn't as creamy as Godiva's either.

I wanted to love Smelly Cat--I really did. (Come on, what's not to love about the name?) And from all the good reviews, I had high expectations. I don't at all consider myself a snob, but it just wasn't my scene. Rustic is nice, but Smelly Cat could have stepped up the decor just a tad. 

The coffee house reminded me of a dive bar. That's not a terrible thing though, right? So, my impression was that I'd at least get a reasonably priced drink. However, I was taken back to find out that a small flavored iced latte would cost me $5.  Whoa...I didn't realize that ice cubes were that hot of a commodity in Charlotte. So I immediately backtracked my order and went with a frappe instead. It tasted alright, though it was on the rich side.

I will give Smelly Cat a thumbs up though for its indoor and outdoor seating. There's definitely plenty of space to chill out and enjoy your food and beverages. Oh, and did I mention they sell beer?

The top slice of bread had more cheese and herbs on it with a slice of sun dried tomato (maybe a regular tomato?) in the middle. The problem with the sandwich was that it wasn't prepared fresh. It tasted like it had been reheated after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Also, the cheese between the bread had not melted in the least. Now because I was in a hurry, I didn't have time to ask for it to be further heated and instead dealt with the dryer than should be sandwich. 

The one redeeming quality was the coffee, which hit the spot and had great flavour.

I hate to sound harsh in a review but this place was over the top with FAIL today.  The failboat had just landed and off-loaded a fresh batch of FAIL.

Customer service:  FAIL.  I walked in, walked up to the counter.  Sole employee in evidence looks over at me, picks up bucket and walks into back room with it.  No ""I'll be right with you"" or ""Excuse me I'll be right back.""  Nothing.  Comes out with bucket of ice.  Dumps bucket into an ice chest.  Repeat three times, never a word.

When he did come to the counter and ask what I would like I felt like waiting on a paying customer was the last thing he wanted to be doing right now because he's much to busy for that.  There was no one in line behind me, by the way.

While I was waiting I had ample opportunity to read the drink menu front to back.  I was delighted to see that they featured a ""signature drink"" iced mocha made with toddy.  I was almost giddy to see toddy on a coffeehouse menu.  I commented that most coffee places don't even know what toddy is and I was very happy to try the ""signature"" iced mocha.

So the guy starts making the ""signature"" iced mocha.  Dumps chocolate syrup into cup.  Starts steamer to brewing two shots of espresso.  ""Excuse me, isn't the iced mocha made with toddy?""  

""I'm making yours with espresso.""  

FAIL.  

""Why aren't you making it with toddy?"" 

""Because the toddy got too cold and froze last night.""  Points to under-counter fridge.

FAIL.

""Why don't you thaw it?""

FAIL

""We have to make more in the cold in the back, it's cold brewed.""  Looks at me like I'm an idiot.

FAIL.

Toddy is brewed with room temperature or cooler water.  The beans are soaked for 12 hours plus, then the water is drained off and you have rich, robust, non-acidic toddy.

Cold brewed in the back...Can't thaw it...

FAIL.

Meeting expectations for ""Signature"" coffee drink:  

FAIL.

Execution on customer service, menu item availability, problem solving and attitude:

Not sure if it was because I drove away and said out loud to my mom  in the car that I wasn't too sure she got the second drink, but we got to the window and she told us the total and gave me the change without a receipt. She handed me the first drink which was a iced black tea with vanilla that I handed to my mom and the barista girl kind of stalled and waited before even handing a straw and the second drink. But it wasn't until I drove to the other side of town that my mom tasted her drink and they had added flan syrup and vanilla syrup to her tea. It was like half her drink was syrup. It's just extremely suspicious that I got no receipt and the awkward standing and stalling makes me think it was purposely done.

This Starbucks is about 5 minutes from my University library, so I've spent a bit of time here. Although it is really small, it has a nice layout and the decor is that of your typical Starbucks. The staff are really friendly too - they always offer a free taste of one of their cakes or sandwiches. 
Whenever I've been here, I've always found myself lurking for a free table, and when I do the staff practically pounce on me to clear up the remains of the previous occupant. So it's very clean!!

This is definitely one of the better Starbucks I've been in.

This morning I took a few friends from Squirrel Hill on a walk around the neighborhood to explore and enjoy some exercise on our various sets of stairs. We decided to treat ourselves afterwards to breakfast and coffee and wanted to stay local, so Lili's was the place!

   As we walked in just after the place opened at 8 AM I first noticed and enjoyed the tile fresco on the floor of the exterior entry. We then entered behind two gentlemen and were treated to some relaxing classical music as we perused the menu boards. The two gentlemen were obviously ""regulars"", judging by how the barista (owner?) knew exactly what they wanted and brought their drinks to them without even having to take their order. I love the type of neighborhood-oriented establishment where people know you this well! After some browsing we placed our orders. My one friend ordered the lox (fish) with capers and cream cheese on a bagel with coffee. I ordered an apple, spinach, and cheese melt on a cinnamon raisin bagel, as did my other breakfast partner. I ordered an iced mocha, and I believe she ordered an espresso. At the last minute I added a blueberry muffin to my order because it looked too good to pass up!

    We sat at a nearby table and began to converse as other neighborhood residents entered for their caffeine fix en route to work. I shared my muffin with my friends, and it was delicious---moist and tasty. My one dining partner received his lox bagel almost immediately and remarked about how good it was. Our bagel melts took longer to come up, and the barista (owner?) apologize for the wait. To say it was awesome is an understatement. The atmosphere overall was very relaxed. After we ate we decided to explore a bit and were pleased to find out there was a back room with more plush seating and even a cute kids' play area built-in under the staircase that leads upstairs to two other businesses. 

    Living in Polish Hill you sort of have to compromise on leaving the neighborhood for most of your basic needs due to our dearth of commerce. With that being said I hope to now become a ""regular"" myself at Lili's, and I can't wait to take my partner here on my next weekend morning off for brunch!","review","jO1pSCw0tv-IyimtVFtPpA",1,0,0,"Lili Coffee Shop","Food,Coffee & Tea",1,16,1,1,11,3,5,8,4,25

I actually felt like I was in a real life city when I was sitting here the other day on my laptop looking out the window. I sorely miss living in a real life city, specifically Boston, so places like this make me super happy. 

Staff are really cool and helpful. Its spacious and clean, and I don't feel like everyone in the place can see my screen, not that there is anything weird on there... okay there probably is, but bottom line is no one else is staring over my shoulder making me feel self conscious about shit I enjoy looking at on the internet. 

The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night. 

O'well.

Another thing I liked about this place is that there aren't 500 hipsters or emo-assholes sitting around looking depressed.. maybe I was lucky that day because it wasn't very crowded at all.

I ordered the omelette with home fries and rye toast.  The omelette was a nice size.  It was filled with the lobster and cheese sauce.  There were some larger pieces of lobster, but most were small pieces.  That didn't detract.  One wouldn't expect a lobster tail in an omelette.  The home fries were very tasty.  Good sized chunks of browned potatoes.  And the rye toast was swirled rye.

Two people, a man and a woman, took orders and brought dishes to the table.  Both were very pleasant and very efficient.  

I was so glad they did the Groupon because I never knew this place existed.  Now that I'm a fan, I'll come back and try some other things.

As others have said, the place is a small, cozy restaurant.  I sat in the back area by the coffee counter where they have just 3 tables.

Lux has a primo location, next to Pane Bianco, just off a train station, and in a great neighborhood. They have a great patio which they share with Bianco, that even though it is loud, it is a nice spot to hang out. 

Their coffee prices are more than fair, $2 for a large coffee, and decent tasting. The biggest thing was not having to pay additional tax, as they have worked it into the prices. I never realized how angry it makes me when something is like $2.03 and I have to walk around with a pocketful of change all day. So those are all the plusses, but I've had a few negative reports as well.

This may or may not be normal, but on my visit, it was a like an akward library. They did not have any music on, there was little to no conversation between customers, and it was very quiet.

My friend ordered the raspberry tart and the rose tea macaron.  The raspberry tart was basically a crust filled with pastry cream and a tier of raspberries.  That was not something we felt was worth almost $7.  Nothing special.  The rose tea macaron was definitely something out of the ordinary but again didn't retrieve enough of our interest to try it in the near future.  It's basically rose tea infused into cream to give it that distinctive taste.  

I went back the next day to the one inside the Aria hotel and got the fruit tart.  Although it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, I wasn't feeling much excitement with the pastry cream nor the crust.  For paying so much for a little pastry, I had high expectations that this would be the best tart I've ever tasted.  Sadly, it just ""looked"" great.

They didn't have a lot of options yet because they had just opened  but they did have a few freshly baked buns on racks. I got a pineapple bun and a bun with hot dog and green onion. They were fresh out of the oven and still pretty hot. I couldn't wait to go home to try one so I sat down at the little table outside and ate the hot dog bun. The bread was light and fluffy and it was even better than the generic hotdog buns I am use to from Boston or NYC.

Sure Mickey Dee's stuff is no better for you but they've got enough experience and it shows.

Again, not reviewing the coffee so it could be the best. The doughnuts are easily beat out by Krispy Kreme in most instances.

Over time, my good friends have also understood this fact about my personality and have hunted down various coffee shops in the valley in efforts to save themselves and the rest of the population from my general obnoxiousness.  I must have been bothering one of my friends couple of weeks ago because she introduced me to Solo Caf√© by stating flatly in a text: ""You need coffee.  Come to Solo Caf√©.""

So, my relationship with Solo Caf√© began, and I can honestly say that I have spent more time in Solo than I have with some people I have dated in the past.  I have produced my best work for my summer classes there because its calm vibe and the interesting artwork keeps me content, and the numerous outlets available throughout the Caf√© feeds my pet - a.k.a. the laptop - as well.

As for the drinks, I can comment on their Americanos since that is the only thing I order at any coffee shop.  Solo Caf√©'s Americano is on the strong side, but it goes down smoothly without any milk.  Also, my insides have never screamed in pain after drinking a large cup of their Americano, so that is a positive sign.  My friend is more interesting than I am, so she orders different types of tea from time to time which all have had favorable reviews from her.  She tried the blue raspberry tea once, and it reminded me of a flavor from a packet of Skittles.  If you are not into the bitterness as I am, I'm sure you will find your niche in the variety of drinks Solo has to offer.   The baristas are always willing to assist in your decision making and to make you feel welcomed, so don't hesitate to ask for an opinion.","review","4GgRyG2HZCyNLZV--x0D6Q",3,2,3,"Solo Caf√© Gourmet Coffee & Tea House","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,5,2,2,6,5,2,8,7,14

The decor was inviting and it was all a buzz with customers. Seemed interesting enough. After moseying over to the mini market area to see several random things, including an all-in-one survival tool and a spoon with bendable arms and legs (this I bought!), I decided I needed some coffee. Stat. 

I put in my order for some Cuban espresso. Then I oogled and drooled over their pastry section. I was tempted to pick up a slice of carrot cake for my dad. It's his favorite. 

Time ticked by. And then, after 10 minutes, I was asked what I was waiting for. Coffee. Simple enough, right? Apparently I should have gone to the OTHER bar to order. The one with the espresso machines. But it was mad busy at the time, so I did what any college-educated java-drinker would do: I went to the first available associate. And she took my order. And my money. But she failed to let the other girl behind the OTHER bar know that I needed some caffeine. 

Not to fear, my order was taken care of, apologies were said more than once and I got a free cookie out of it. By the way, that truffle chocolate cookie was AMAZING. So was the Cuban espresso. 

Definitely worth checking out. Hopefully they get that ordering glitch fixed soon.","review","APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA",1,0,1,"Liberty Market","Food,Coffee & Tea,American (New),Restaurants",3,6,1,3,5,1,2,6,2,12

And HOT DAYUMN, that is me some good coffee! Look, I'm a self-professed coffee snob and I've been known to send back a coffee if it simply wasn't good enough. But this macchiato, it had me in tears, it was so dark and strong and sexy, I wanted to cuddle with it. And judging by the clientele, that would've been entirely acceptable.

I've got nothing but good things to say about their coffee, the machine is cleaned regularly (yes, you can taste the difference, if it's a metallic taste, it's no good!) and the crema was perfect. (Meaning that the pressure and the roast of the beans were exquisite as well.)

Funniest thing, as our second round of lattes arrived at the table, me and my friend both were staring at them for a good five minutes, mesmerised. Just because they were so ... strangely beautiful. (Remember that plastic bag in American Beauty ....?)

Now for the venue, I would like a wee bit more effort put into the decor. It's not that I don't like it, it's just, a little bit more effort would go a long way. By that I mean, can I get some comfy seating up in here! I agree with Jenny as far as the seats go, I'm a cushy-plushy-seat-lover myself, (preferably with a bag of cookies and a good book) so I did start to feel my back after a while, but  to be fair, I hung around for a good three hours. Oh and open up a shop three times as big please, thank you, and I'd never leave.

Has anyone noticed by the way, that the hipsters are multiplying? One of the befuddled hipsters (spot on there Jason M.) had a most extraordinary moustache going on. 'T was grand (and curly).

In an attempt to visit non-touristy spots, I came across Baguette Cafe on Yelp.  It's about 20 minutes away from the strip and is located in a business park.  If you're coming here for the first time, it can be a little hard to find, but don't give up because it's worth it!!

The service is excellent where the person who took my order asked me questions about myself and even introduced himself.  He asked me if I've ever been here before too (which is such a difference from the robots who work on the strip restaurants and cafes).  

I ordered their daily special, a Morrocan chicken sandwich.  The chicken was seriously the moistest chicken I've ever had.  I quickly ate my sandwich not only because I was hungry, but this place is a little small, so getting a table might be hard to do when it's busy.  There are tables outside, however, I visited in August and it was 110 degrees outside.","review","XOVzm5AYOazSjHnzI1nTdA",1,0,2,"Baguette Cafe","Food,Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",1,5,0,3,3,2,1,2,5,8

The chicken sandwich was very good, the prime rib was excellent, as was the New York strip. Service was prompt and friendly.

Today Chris recommended the new flavoring, dark chocolate and raspberry, and wow. It was like drinking candy.

I got a latte, instead. This puts me in an awkward position. Do I return the cappuccino? It costs a lot. I ended up drinking it. As a former barista myself, cappuccinos can be tricky to make - but a little practice can turn out the real deal with frothy perfection. 

The next time I went to the Victory was another meh moment. I fully appreciate the Victory's support and stand against the present Governor's autrocities - however, I do like looking out the window to watch life passing by. There's too many signs, and not all of them are that attractive. Sometimes, you just need a break from life - and yes, we are having hard times right now - but do I have to be reminded by the barrage of signs when all I want to do is enjoy my cup of coffee, do a little people watching, and see what's going on from that corner in the neighborhood? One or two signs would be good enough. There's too much of a coolness factor, too. Lots of ""hipsters"" hanging out there, who will give you icy stares if you so much as look at them. Guess I'm not ""hipster"" enough. Which is really kind of weird. Madison is not really a completely friendly place, anyways - but it is very apparent for some reason in the Victory.

I ordered coffee this time - and it was very delicious, but I would have liked more. There's no indication that you can get a refill, and there are no prices anywhere. In fact, there is no menu. It's hard to tell what the beverage choices are and how much it is going to set you back. I was delighted to see gluten free goodies, but alas, no one there knew what the exact ingredients are - and so I couldn't order any of them, having more than one allergy myself. It's kind of ironic - they're so pro-working class, and yet they don't list prices, which any working class person would want to know before spending his or her hard earned money, and meanwhile, there are a bunch of  cool cats hanging out at the tiny tables, saying ""look at me, aren't I cool"" while evaluating everybody else with icy looks. Very entertaining in a way, but not on my dime next time.","review","cMfvLtBnyXo5xlm9IB-8Og",0,0,0,"The Victory","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,16,3,3,14,2,8,14,5,23

My typical drink is a triple espresso on ice. The first time I ordered one I was charged about $2.95. I pay $2.54 at Starbucks (with my 10 cent cup discount). Okay, I get it, no big deal. The next time I ordered the same drink the cost was $3.24 ish. I asked about the difference and the gal explained to me that it's because I asked for ice in my espresso making it an Americano. She did go ahead and lower the price back to $2.95 (ish). 

3rd times a charm... meet my roommate there. I have my little dog with me. I realize that they probably do not allow dogs. Before I can order or receive a greeting I was told sternly that the dog can't stay. No big deal, we can sit outside. I order my triple and yep... $3.24 (70 cents more than Starbucks). I mention that I do not understand how the ice makes the drink an Americano. The gal gives me some explanation that honestly I think it's B.S. 

The thing is... When I walk into Starbucks, they know me... the greet me... they are friendly... 

At Holley's I do not feel welcomed or valued. I would expect more from a local coffee house. They come across uppity to me.

We slept in and decided to get breakfast. The diner near the fish market had a really long line and we could not find street parking.

So, we mobile yelped and found J'eet. The setting and building reminded us of Brooklyn. I was sick and in a grumpy mood once again. I wanted to be on the road to get back home.

When we wanted a great satisfying breakfast to end our short trip of Pitt became Lunch. We all ordered the pre-fixed breakfast brunch. The fruit salad is actually fruit cocktail form the can. Then waited half an hour for our egg entrees to come out. 3 of our plates we just luke warm. The potatoes was under cooked. Then table of 4 which was seated after us already left once we finished out entree. Then we waited another 30 for our crepes to come out. 

As we were waiting for our crepes to come out we complained and they acknowledged that they were slow on our order. The waiter didn't charge us for the up-sell for the specialty crepes. Whoa 4 bucks. 

I felt disrespected having to wait almost 2 hours for breakfast. It's wrong to see people seated half an hour we've been there leave happily full. And to see crepes that we ordered go to other tables was the icing on the pancake.

I settled on the old reliable, made from dark roasted cocoa beans sez the tag, to satisfy my craving. [sorry, I'm just not into coffee ice cream, thanks anyway!!] The nice lady crammed a humongous scoop of the Dark Cocoa Brown confection on a plain cone [my fave!], and she even put the whole thing into a cup for me so I could drive off with my fix. 

That said--the selection is kind of thin, it's like a Fresh & Easy version of an ice cream joint. It's in the old Willo candle store, so you know there's gonna be at least some parking. $2.95 for a big scoop of ice cream was a bit stiff IMHO, but when you're jones'ing for an icy chocolatey treat, no cost is too high.

What's more, this place prides itself on making everything from scratch and on-site, or rather, ""Qualit√§t aus Meisterhand"" as they put it.

The other great thing about them is that they'll also bake you an entire cake exactly to your liking if you order in advance. So next time you're trying to show off your domesticated baking skills, but accidentally forget to turn the oven on or use the wrong type of flour, this place will save the day.

The drive thru is convenient, coffee was good, and service was great.  One issue that I have with the Mad House is that their drive thru menu is so damn high.

My bf had the waffle with mango and pineapple. We also tried the Boba Thai Tea. Everything was delicious. EVERYTHING. My flax seed waffle had a funnel cake- ish texture almost.It was still light  and soooo good.It was topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream (which he went light on)I also topped it with a little of their strawberry syrup, Divine! The egg whites were awesome, they seemed very fresh. The bacon was ok, nothing special. Even though my bf's waffle was gone in a blink of an eye I did manage to taste some and his regular waffle with the  kiwi and pineapple topping.His fruit topping too were fresh and sweet. Neither one of us have ever had a Boba Tea so this was our first time. Needless to say I'm hooked. It was sweet and creamy. Very good.

Merchandise: A decent variety.  Their cake displays were breath-taking. Very handy crafts man ships.  Pricey though.

Pastries:  loved the nutella cake.  That's the only one that made me lose it.  Apple cinnamon muffin was moist and crunchy just how a perfect muffin should be.  All of them were a piece of edible art.  Nothing looked bland nor does it taste bland.  

-1 for the snooty attitude from that girl.  I know you're mad about working on Black Friday but c'mon!  And those lines are so confusing.  I think there was 3 lines: gelato, crepes, and pastries? I'm not sure but I don't care as long as I get my sweets.

I have been here a few times. With other fellow yelpers and my babe. I'm giving four stars because I like the atmosphere and decor inside as well as the many drinks and treats. I usually try to be adventurous and try new drinks, but I stick with the honey toast every time. I'm not a huge macaron fan, but I've heard those are pretty good. So far I've only been able to try the strawberry smoothie, peach tea and mocha frap. Out of those three I enjoyed the mocha frap the most. The strawberry smoothie and peach tea were extremely too sweet for me, which was disappointing. That won't deter me from trying other drinks.

1- I really dig the Roosevelt area. Wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon and the surrounding buildings and palm trees make for a great leisurely walk with your coffee.
2- The service was great. The barista working was enjoying  a slower moment out on a bench with friends in front of the shop and as we arrived she got up immediately, greeted us kindly and told us she was going to go wash her hands before helping us and making our drinks. Having worked at a coffee joint myself once, I understand the slow times and the perks of helping a shift go by much easier when friends stop by and I'm glad she gets to hang out while understanding the importance of customer service. Go you barista lady!
3- The drinks were great! What more can you really ask for when you are purchasing a coffee. I got a large iced mocha with two shots instead of four (four would kill me) and my boyfriend got a medium iced latte. We are kind of coffee snobs and the drinks were wonderful. I normally order an iced toddy or an iced americano but was feeling rather indulgent that day.
4- The atmosphere was my style. Big open room, great tunes!, lots of places to sit to use your laptop, seating outside in front of the shop as well as great seating outdoors behind the shop and here's the kicker.. the bathrooms were clean and I didn't cringe or hold my breath while using it.
5- They are local and they hang local art. Anything local in my book, is a win.

This place is great. On my days off it will be a great place to sit and escape with my laptop or my current read.","review","7aQvAhgpdXqkTQEp8b8Szw",1,1,1,"Lola Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",1,8,2,4,8,4,3,7,5,15

Horrible service. Please, please, please do not go to this Starbucks! There are many other locations throughout the strip, so do NOT waste you're time at this grouchy location.

I came here to order a venti peach black tea for my mom and a grande iced water with two scoops of matcha for myself.

First off, the cashier girl (Tania) doesn't smile at all when greeting customers. When I order the drink she doesn't really listen. She had to ask what I ordered after I finished ordering. When I ordered my drink she said that they don't do that anymore.. I asked if I could just buy the matcha and water and she rudely said no. She asked if I wanted to get something else and I said no and another worker who was standing by her said that they were running really low on matcha powder. So, there was matcha powder available, but I couldn't have any because I didn't order one of their expensive drinks. I am lactose intolerant so I didn't really want to buy a green tea frap, but still wanted matcha.. 

Instead of suggesting something else for me she just happily talks to coworkers and then once again rudely turns back to me and asks what my name is with a scowl on her face. (I guess it sounded like I said Aylen?) 

Even if you don't want to give customers iced water with scoops of your matcha powder, you could at least say it nicely. I totally would not care if I was just told that it was their store policy to not serve that, but I just can't believe that Starbucks would hire such unpleasant workers for a customer service position.

When you wait for your drink just keep an eye out, because they will not call out your drink or name written on the cup.","review","lk5wAvMrVQWRl0YBE5mD7A",0,1,2,"Starbucks","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,4,5,2,4,4,3,6,9,8

This boba place has always been very close to my past few safe houses.  In fact if you were to plot the past safe house locations on the map, Easy Life Boba Tea will pretty much be in the middle.  Just an observation.

Anyway, there has been some recent activities on the fluffy snow ice scene in Las Vegas, with one opened by a celebrity chef and another by individuals completely off the radar.  If you are an active duty Yelp operative, you will likely know their names, employment history, and what they did last summer.

My visit to ELBT is to check out how the fluffy snow ice measures up to the new competitions.  So here is my report based on my observations and my order of a Large Mango Snow with Green Apple Jelly, Strawberry and Mango with Condensed Milk:

Sizes (3):
Small ($5.25 includes 1 regular and 1 premium toppings)
Medium (No show. Must be out of this most average & popular of container sizes)
Large ($7.25 includes 1 regular and 2 premium toppings)
Jumbo ($9.25 includes 2 regular and 2 premium toppings)

The Small is perfect for a snack for one. Large is big enough for me, but it is pretty much a meal replacement.  Jumbo is suitable for competitive eaters, but best shared with a few friends that does not mind cooties.  If they do, they can get their own Small or have a friend administers a cootie shot.  

Flavors comes in three varieties (Strawberry, Mango and Thai Tea), so if just competing on that simplistic variable alone, ELBT comes in with the least amount of ""snow"" selections. 

Toppings:  8 regular (Boba, Mochi, Pudding, Red Bean, Lichi Jelly, Coconut Jelly and Green Apple Jelly) and 6 premium (Mango, Strawberry, Kiwi, Banana, Aloe Vera and Coffee Jelly).  

Flavoring (aka Sauce): 4 to drizzle with (Condensed Milk, Chocolate Syrup, Brown Sugar Syrup, Caramel Syrup).

Again, overall number of selection to top off and customize your ""snow"" order with is not bad, but falls short of the competition.  But ELBT have the majority of the stuff I would want to order normally, so I don't care if they don't have gummy bears, Cap't Crunch, M&M's, etc. on their list.

Texture & Flavor:  Texture of the fluffy snow here is decent. However, you can still easily detect the slightly gritty ice crystals in your mouth, but it is a vast improvement over the offering at Kuma, but still not as perfect as Frost Bites Shavery (recently re-branded SnowFlake Shavery and relocated to their new brick and mortar location on Spring Mountain/Decatur in late Aug. 2013).  Flavor of the snow is good (but not made from all natural ingredients), not too strong or mild, but just enough.

Service:  High schoolers behind the counter, so your service mileage will vary greatly depending on the usual variables (cuteness, personality, your kicks,etc.)

So when it is hot and you want something to cool you down, and flavored snow dessert is what you crave, apply sun block (SPF40+) according to instruction and drive/bike/bus/teleport yourself to ELBT for a cool one.

Greater than A-OK.

The coffee shop offers a good selection of coffees for a fair price. The ambiance is relaxed and the large windows grant a beautiful view of Notre-Dame Street. Why only 3 stars then? Well, while the coffee grain is good, the preparation is inconsistent; depending on the barista, the taste of a latte will fluctuate significantly, resulting sometimes in a great caf√© latte, other times in a surprisingly tasteless diluted drink. And while it's not a total catastrophe (I do keep coming back after all), I believe such a high degree of inconsistency does affect the overall experience negatively. 

In spite of the hit or miss coffee preparation, I would still recommend Saint-Henri.  Great location, casual atmosphere and one out of two times a great coffee.","review","s5yX8QkVNNvgOopBckHDgw",2,6,3,"Saint-Henri micro-torr√©facteur","Food,Coffee & Tea",4,9,3,1,6,1,6,7,5,10

Who comes here for chicken? Apparently a lot of people! It's one of the more popular items ordered and they get a lot of customers from Vegas just for Broaster's Chicken according to the owner.
 
What's broasted chicken? Well here are the deets:

""it's a different method of cooking chicken, pressure cooked, it's more moist and less greasy than fried chicken"" ..that's how it was explained to us by the owner.

The verdict:

I was skeptical at first but now I'm a fan of broasted chicken. It's pretty good! It is moist and juicy, the skin is slightly crisp. The flavor goes down right down to the bone, like it's been brined. Nice! Biggest appeal, NOT GREASY AT ALL!
   
Added bonus are the health benefits...less calories, less carbs, less fat, Im  so down for that!

They have individual meal deals, family packs with sides (mac&cheese, potato salad, mixed greens) and/or you can order chicken 8-20 pieces.

Be mindful that chicken is cooked to order.  We were told 15 min wait for ours. No worries! I'd much rather wait a few more minutes than have chicken that's been sitting under heat lamps you know?

You can call ahead your order and pick it up at their drive thru. How convenient!  We just ordered ours though to-go and had our Dole Whip while we waited.
 
Since our chicken was a to-go order it was packaged in a thick cardboard box. It still held well and retained heat when we got home.
 
Prices are slightly high, especially if you are getting that 20 meal deal. Then again I cant speak or compare prices to the popular fried chicken franchises since I haven't stepped foot in them in last fifteen plus years.
  
As for the bakery cafe itself, it's been expanded since October, bright, clean, plenty of room, the dining area has a few tables and chairs. The kitchen where they prepare everything looked clean and organized and pretty big too.

Heads Up! The stand where they were originally at is now a hot dog stand run by Chilly Jilly'z it just opened! 
 
Staff and service was great. Everyone was helpful and friendly.  Even when some customer was whining about how long their corn dog was taking to cook, they were more than apologetic and respectful to that person than I would've been. Sheesh people!

It has all of the elements necessary for a ""go to"" spot:

Good drinks: My favorites are the Black and White Frost, Mint Mocha Frost, and Deadly Soda. 

Good Customer Service: The baristas are always cheerful, very quick, and sometimes a bit quirky

Nice enough indoor seating: It isn't plush, at all. But, there always seems to be enough seating, and the groupings of tables and chairs are varied enough that there is generally space to comfortably seat groups of any size (from tables of 2 for my hubby and I to a banquette table that we could squish 8 people into if needed)

Free Internet Access with the purchase of a drink: When you buy your drink, you can ask for a code to log onto the internet. It is good for 3 hours. I can't imagine complaining about 3 hours of free internet - if you've sat in the restaurant for 3 hours, its time to buy another drink anyway. Their process is painless and the connection is always decent, unlike other ""free internet"" places where you are subject to a limited amount of bandwidth that can be taken up by squatters who aren't buying anything and are streaming videos, music, etc for hours on end. 

Loyalty Card: You know the drill - you get a card, they stamp it, you get a free drink eventually. Its nice to have and is an incentive for me to return to Coffee Rush locations instead of hitting up a competitor.

There are a few things that are just okay - namely, the pastry selection and the patio.

The pastry selection is pretty disappointing. I got a muffin once and it was just sort of crumbly and average. The things in the case don't really ever look very good and aren't your typical coffee shop fare - think storebought cheesecake and baklava instead of muffins, breakfast breads, croissants, etc.

The patio is actually quite nice - spacious, shaded, has misters, plenty of seating, lots of plug ins for laptops, etc. However, they allow smoking out there and so, being a non-smoking asthmatic, I unfortunately can't comfortably spend time out there. My wish is that they would either a) disallow smoking, which I realize isn't likely or b) have two separate patios - a smoking patio and a non-smoking patio, preferably on opposite sides of the building. For the moment, I just stay inside, which is generally just fine since its 100 degrees or more outside anyway.

I can definitely recommend Coffee Rush! Check it out :)

This will be a regular stop any time we make it to the strip district. It's a small hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but easy enough to find. The donuts are better than what you would expect from your local chain so I don't mind paying extra for them. There are plenty of good flavor options. I would definitely recommend trying the banana crunch donuts (sans hair). 

I prefer to review businesses based on the experience. Contrary to what you may hear, none of the staff forced us to listen to their social opinions.

Huh?

Instantaneous loss of credibility. 

Yeah. So that said, the cash only deal is a bummer. Does anyone under 50 carry cash anymore? Total pain in the ass. If I have nine dollars on me, I don't to spend it all on overpriced coffee. The coffee itself is okay, very strong and a little burnt, as seems to be the trend in recent years. I could make it palatable with a lot of cream and some funky all-natural organic free trade green sugar-free alternative. It was definitely way too strong for my SO, who made a bit of a sphincter face with his first sip.

The pastries are from Tammie Coe -- tasty, yes, but nothing you can't get elsewhere.

The space IS gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and it's my favorite part of this shop. Disappointingly, the bathrooms are really average. Usually spiffy places like this have bomb ass bathrooms. The attached Bunky Boutique is super cute, and it deserves its own review.

The reason why I love Dutch so much is:

1. Their coffee is a little lighter compared to the rest.
2. It's fast service. Definitely faster when going down to order instead of drive thru. But they crank out coffee like a machine!
3. The baristas work magic. They are fun, friendly, and have genuine conversations with you.

Finally, some get coffee for the taste and options. Most, like myself, love the taste and options, but I go for energy! This place jams music to get you pumped up for the day.

Yet it was the first time I went to Beetlejuice, despite working and living in the area for the past 2 years. So, when waiting outside The Couting House for a Fringe show, and being hungry, I popped over for a bite to eat.

The first thing I noticed was how cheap it was! ¬£2.50 for a bagel. ¬£3.50 for a wrap. They only take cash, so I counted it out and with ¬£3.50 to spend I felt like a wee kid in a sweet shop again, when you literally count out your 10ps till you get to the right amount for your tasty treat.

I got the Mexican chicken wrap. Now, it wasn't quite Mexican chicken as I expected. Basically a wrap filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, 'spicy chicken' (that was sweet chilli spicy, not mexican spices. A big difference in my condiments book), and then sour cream and jalapenos. So not as Mexican as I would have liked (no paprika, no cajun spices, no GUACALMOLE!) but what I did get was a lot of chicken and a really big filling wrap for ¬£3.50.

The guy did forget to make my wrap and seemed to be really laid back and slow as he went generally. So I had a wee bit of a wait. But he apologised and was nice about it.

So, a lot of stars for the cheap price, and the fresh large portion. But for the slow-ish service, and rather basic style of food that it is, it's not 4 or 5 stars for me.

These are the worst bagels I've ever had that weren't purchased from a supermarket or a dirty food truck.  I took two bites and threw out my very expensive breakfast.

Ignore the other reviews for Owen's.  It's clear that these people have no idea what a bagel is supposed to taste like.  This place is a joke.  Let's get specific:

#1)  Flavor:  there isn't any.  These things have all the excitement of wonder bread.

#2)  Texture:  Mush.   Bagel's are supposed to be soft, dense and chewy on the inside with a crispy but yielding skin on the outside.   At Owen's you get a steamed pile of mushy goo.  Yes, STEAMED... more on that in a moment.

#3)  Toppings:  As any true New Yorker would do, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese a lox (that's smoked salmon for you North Carolina natives).  The fish they served me smelled really bad- not fresh at all... but what can you expect from an establishment that prides itself on Boar's Head meats?  Sidenote: Boar's Head is the Hunt's ketchup of deli meats- an inferior product that somehow maintains astonishing market share, despite offending anyone with taste buds.

Okay, so back to the part where they STEAMED my bagel:  I had asked for a TOASTED onion bagel, because that's the proper way to warm a bagel.  The moron behind the counter nodded dumbly and didn't mention that apparently Owen's doesn't OWN A TOASTER!   Instead, without informing me, she STEAMS my bagel, turning it instantly into soft, gooey mess, without even a hint of the crispy crust that the bagel may have started with.  If any heating method is the exact opposite of toasting a bagel, it's STEAMING a bagel.  It's like steaming a pizza or a hamburger... you just don't do it. 

If I could give Owen's Bagel's a rating with negative stars, that's what I'd be doing right now. 

After throwing out the worst bagel ever from Owen's, I drove a few minutes away to Bruegger's.   Sure, Bruegger's in a boring chain, but they at least know how to make a bagel that doesn't suck, and they understand how to work a toaster.  Also their smoked salmon was fresh.  I never thought I'd recommend them over an independently owned Bagel shop, but in this case, I have to.","review","LMLvq8jnQ4UsN_G8rLNx_A",0,2,1,"Owen's Bagel & Deli","Food,Bagels,Coffee & Tea,Delis,Restaurants",2,5,4,4,5,5,3,7,14,10

I'm sure you've all been to a SBX before, so I won't go into detail about the variety of drinks they serve. But I will tell you I just had the coconut creme Frap yesterday afternoon, and it was awesome. I believe it's only a seasonal thing, so I don't know how long it'll be around, but you should check it out next time you're up there. 

In regards to this particular SBX, I like it. The baristas are friendly, and they're usually pretty cool when the office places large orders of a bunch of Fraps. They've never messed up my orders, which is something that happened occasionally at the UNLV Starbucks I used to frequent so much. Plus, they're pretty quick. In the mornings, I usually just get a cup of coffee and sometimes a scone, and I can be in and out of that place in less than 2 minutes. I love that. 

My only complaint with SBX as a whole is that I'm not sure that paying $3 for their coffee is worth it all the time. It's consistently a good cup of coffee, sure, but it's not consistently a GREAT cup of coffee. I can get pretty good coffee for 79 cents at the Terrible's and it's consistently average.

No matter the circumstance, and I don't even know if she worked an all day/night shift, she should have been friendly. That aside, I notice some man mopping the floors, water going *wooosh* inside where the donuts are just laying there on the machine. I could not believe my eyes!! The labels did not match the donuts on display and when we asked her to clarify, she gave us a long speech about how they distribute donuts to the gas stations and blah blah blah. I was honestly ready to walk out but we were lucky enough to just pick out the donuts on display that were at least covered by a glass door.

"-fAyUiP1o0hAodEhGdziyw","2013-07-19","Go9qKRtA65h-CqsPfvnekQ",2,"You know, when this place first opened (and I was there like, a half hour after they flung the doors open on their first day...) I was a total Alterra evangelist. The coffee was good, the internet free and blazing fast, the staff friendly and upbeat; in short, much of what you'd like in a cafe that charges more than the average for their food and caffeine. 

But then the sheen started to wear off, and quick! I don't want to sandwich this review with the things I like, somethings needing improvement, and then ending with a pretty little bow saying something like, ""but I still love this place!"" Read down, and you'll find plenty of that. 

1) Their hours. What? Why, in a city like Madison, and in such a central location, does Alterra close at 9:00? Why is it so much to ask for a cafe to stay open until like, 11:00? I know Barriques closes at 11 on Thursdays-Saturdays, but for some of us, we're just hitting our stride at 7:45PM, leaving us with less than 2 hours of good stride time. C'mon folks, let's keep some big-kid hours. 

2) The music is really really terrible. I mean, atrociously terrible. It's like your high school's collective mix CD's were dumped into a CD player and thrown on shuffle, and even features the irregular volume levels inherent in all those purloined tracks! In addition to being a total crapshoot of what kind of aural assault you're going to get, it's loud as all get out. On numerous occasions, I've gone up to the counter to ask them, like your dad always did to you, to turn it down. It's gotten to the point where, upon my approach, an employee will say: ""Is it too loud? Should I turn it down?"" Yes. Yes it is too loud, and it takes over my noise-canceling headphones. And if you already know what I'm going to ask, that means you already know it's too loud. Just turn it down so conversations don't need to rise to scream-talking. 

3) Boy oh boy has the staff gotten surly. If you read my account of Johnson Public House, you'll know that I don't mind a bit of hipster-barista surliness with my coffee. It's par for the course... in *some* cafes. This is not the cafe. This is the bougie, over-priced, grown adult cafe. I'm paying more for my coffee than I would otherwise, and I expect the attitude to be dialed back. Granted, Alterra's management could be a right bear to work for, and may engender a surly staff, who knows? But if that's the case: ALTERRA MANAGEMENT: stop treating your employees poorly. They're unfriendly, and that makes me not want to come here. If it's just because they're bad at hiring people, and their staff thinks they're hot stuff 'cause they work at Alterra, then give me a break. 

4) On the employee tip, those bathrooms, single stall each, sure do get gnarly after a while. During the workaday week, there are typically lines out the door (I don't even want to know about what happens during the farmer's market... I avoid the square at all costs unless, you know, I'm at the market,) and that means that precious bathroom real estate (which often has lines rivaling the counter's,) gets trashed. Instead of standing around navel-gazing, it might be a good idea to check the bathrooms now and then. And maybe clean up after the circus has packed up and left? But instead, I see staff wandering about, seemingly aimlessly, all the while the bathrooms go untouched (making me not to want to touch them). And restock the creamer station while you're at it (and after changing gloves and scrubbing your paws, please.) I can't believe how many times I've gone over to get a straw or napkin and found the remains of what once was a supply bar. 

Anyway, there's my beef. I know we can't have everything all the time, but some things are easier had than others. And I think these are some low, low-hanging fruit.","review","643OtOfYkiJrzB8tRyhF_Q",1,1,4,"Colectivo Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",11,10,11,13,13,8,7,17,18,26

Freeman as a cafe, has character! The furniture may not be perfectly matched but the atmosphere and the couches definitely gives it a homely feeling. For the kids, they even have a blackboard and chalk to boot! YAY for freestyle chalk art!

The service here is fantastic! Super friendly, but there's attention to detail. I see a short cursory shake on my drinks usually before it's handed off to me, but here he shook everything to make sure it was chilled as well as well as all the boba is separated and not clumped together. After we took a sip, he asked if everything tasted good or if there was any tweaks we needed. It was fine as is, but it's appreciated that they ask.

As with most here who agree that although the boba at Chinatown are delicious as well, it's VERY convienient to have a shop such as this located in the Henderson area. Although I am a regular at buying milk tea drinks, I decided to switch gears and order one of their ""Ice Milk"" drinks. More specifically, I ordered the Ice milk with caramel, pudding, and honey boba.

One thing I can definitely say was that this was the most refreshing boba drink I've ever had. It was the perfect amount of sweetness for me, as well as the smoothness (for slush). The ice blend/slush made the milk so refreshingly sweet and cold to the point where I couldn't put this drink down. The caramel added more flavor (almost resembling that of toffee).

I also had pudding for the first time in my boba and it was yummy as well. Not that much flavor in the pudding except for a slight vanilla or custard taste but, hey it works and definitely makes boba more enjoyable to drink.  I'm not too picky on boba texture, but it was chewy and soft and the syrup blended well into the drink.

Overall, this drink resembled a light cr√®me brulee. I would absolutely order this drink again.

On to service. I was happily greeted and as I was ordering, he (I forgot to catch his name) had informed me of the various sizes of the shakes, why they are so big, and also provide me with a stamp card. As I received my order, he informed me of how to mix their drinks since all of the goods are at the bottom (the best part). The shop is very spacious and has minimal seating area.

But that doesn't matter, since the food and atmosphere are both rather nice.

I LOVE Mediterranean food. I can't get enough of it. So this place does me nicely. They do great snacks, an amazing hangover cure breakfast (which isn't Greek inspired, but for 2.50 it's better than buying paracetomol if you've got a raging headache), panini's, wraps packed with fillings and mains such as my all time fave mousakka. 

Additionally, they have light bites such as salads, plus dishes such as a spinach and feta pastry which may add a bit of flavour to your diet. Certainly there are some small dishes in here I've never tried before, and since they are an affordable way to work your way through the Mediterranean menu it's not too shabby.

I visited this cafe on a summer's evening, when at 7pm there were drunks staggering about from neighbouring areas. I don't know if it was that feeling of deprivation from neighbourhoods I had walked through to get to this place that made it stand out, or just the fact that it's nice. But since it's a spacious, clean cafe offering you that little bit extra in terms of menu options, it certainly stands apart from other cafe's in this neck of the woods.","review","pAZYqb6OuPjlHF7AeGy6uQ",0,0,0,"Double Dutch","Food,Coffee & Tea,Mediterranean,British,Restaurants",3,2,4,3,8,2,2,8,7,16

Sure, there are a lot of Starbucks, but I mean a place that has coffee that doesn't taste like water.  This lack of coffee houses is especially true near where I live in east Vegas.  There are a couple, but none that really have the feel I want.  

But alas!  I have found a place.  The coffee was very good, the cappuccinos are great, they offer the option of a french press, and even their iced coffee was great!  The coffee was from Klatch Coffee, a small family roaster in Southern California, and you could tell they took the extra effort to find a great roaster.  

I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but after endless terrible cappuccinos I thought that maybe I'd never find a great cappuccino in Las Vegas.  But when I got my first sip of the cappuccino at Sunrise Coffee, it was more than just a sip, it was a renewed faith in Las Vegas coffee.  The coffee was flavorful, yet smooth, and when combined with perfect froth it created a great cappuccino.

But I didn't feel overly enamoured by the atmosphere which was a little lacking. Double Dutch is also a touch more expensive than other cafes nearby, an all important issue in a student area.

The place itself is pretty big and open with out door seating to boot. Though even still it can get quite busy around 12-2. As has been pointed out in other reviews, the food itself is actually more standard British/Mediterranean.

The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day.

It blew my mind. They had literally the BEST FAKE TUNA ( spicy vegan tuna wrap) known to man. No joke. Ever since i went vegan i've still craved tuna. and TUNO is Okay, but it just didn't really do it for me. This, on the other hand was JUST like eating tuna. And the sauces and tortillas they use on their wraps. TO DIE FOR!!!

On my vacation i ate here a few times. I had the vegan cuban panini ( YUM!), the buffalo vegan chicken wrap ( OMG), teriyaki mushroom chicken burger ( HEEEEELL YEAH)  and the red velvet cake and chocolate chip cookie sandwiches. 

They can make almost their ENTIRE menu vegan includling pizzas, wraps, sandwiches, TONS of cake and desserts ( tiramisu cake, peanut butter and jelly cake, pumpkin cake, etc) They have daiya vegan cheese which they actually take the time to MELT down right, which a lot of places with vegan items don't. 

If you're vegetarian or vegan in vegas you MUST go here. its right in the fashion mall off the strip across from The Wynn. and you'll die just as much as I did....it was unreal. :D","review","kFV066J3d9K4NbWcdmvWXQ",0,0,0,"Red Velvet Caf√©","Food,Coffee & Tea,American (New),Vegan,Restaurants",0,4,0,3,2,3,0,1,5,3

The space is set up really well and has a nice vibe.  Their mint iced green tea is good too.  What put me off from wanting to stay and work at Julia's was that the A/C was blasted, I actually thought I was sitting underneath a fan (goosebumps on my skin were out of control!).  Also there's not a whole lot of natural light upstairs (not sure how they could change that) but it was kind of a bummer to have to utlize the table lamp because it was so dark.  On the positives, the service is very good (barista was super friendly) and the other staff are really on top of cleaning cleared tables once people get up to leave.  The place is kept very clean.  I guess if I needed coffee or tea and was nearby I'd stop here, but it's not my ideal spot for staying a long time and getting work done.

 Walking by to decide where to grab a quick bite, the Cafe looked relaxing and fresh.

There were 2 girls at the counter and 1 guy in the back kitchen for a bistro that had looked empty.  Everything you can order is in the display case or displayed on the counter, some items are sold out. 

The girls said the cookies are made fresh everyday. I looked at the cookie wrapper and it had an expiry date of tomorrow , yes fresh!

The girls were very helpful and I ordered a Ciabatta, a Cesar Salad mixed with a bit of the Spinach salad, a Large Coffee, and an Oatmeal cookie.

The Ciabatta was Ham and Brie with spinach in it. They put it in a hot press and serve cut in half. It was crunchy and tasty, the cheese didn't really melt but was still a good sandwich.

The Caesar was tasty and still crunchy ( you never know with ready made salads from a display case..). It had bits of Real Bacon, real Parmesan , still crunchy seasoned croutons made with their toasted multigrain bread, the dressing was light and flavourful .  Delicious Caesar salad yumm. 

I also got to try the Spinach salad too and it had baby spinach greens, a delicate dressing and crunchy Chop Souey.  Really great salads and decent portion.

The Oatmeal cookie was not chewy, it was crumbly  and wasn't overly sweet. It let the Oats flavour shine through .

 The Kureg coffee maker at the InterContinental Hotel across the street had the Van Houtte coffee Pods. 

    The coffee is always going to be good if its Al Van Houtte.

After much indecision, I ordered the Grilled Cheese Sandwich (with 3 types of cheeses, tomatoes, and avocado) and I asked for Bacon on it as well. The husband ordered the Tuna Melt, his sister ordered the Portobello Sandwich, and the in-laws shared the BBQ Bacon Burger. (Some came with salads and others came with fries.) We ordered the Hummus Trio as a starter as well. The in-laws had never had Hummus before and were leery of the delicious dish, but were pleasantly surprised. The trio had red bell pepper, cilantro and regular hummus. All three were delicious and we had to order extra pita. The food came quickly after and everyone enjoyed their dishes. The waitress was really nice and attentive to refilling out water and asking if we needed anything. The place seemed pretty dead, but it was nice sitting on the patio.

"jCUOqEK8Lln0PK3GeUl6IQ","2014-07-20","zLovlROrEjcf_vvZ4vJSGQ",3,"First off, the atmosphere is pretty cool. It has a laid-back and indie kind of vibe going on. Lots of interesting people drinking their coffee, some students, some people having conversation--it's all good. I'm not a person that is bothered by the background noise of a coffee house (in fact, the noise helps me focus), hence why I frequent them to study. So why the three-star rating?

Atmosphere aside, this place was a little odd. It kind of feels like a sideshow of sorts and coffee house awkwardly pieced together....

1. When I walked up to the display counter I checked out the various muffins and cookies (which are monstrous). I placed an order for a mocha and then asked the person upfront what one of the cookies were, as there was no label for them. She looked at them, looked surprised and said that she didn't know and would have to ask someone to find out. Then she stood there and stared at me. After a few seconds she asked me if I wanted something. ""Um.....yeah, I wanted to know what kind of cookie that is so I can figure out if I want to buy it...??"" Duh. Seriously? Are you not going to sell me the cookie? Am I crazy to expect that you'll ask someone next to you if you don't know? Strange. 

2. The place was eerily quiet when I first sat. No music. No loud voices---people were basically quiet and doing their own thing, surprisingly. (usually there is that ONE loud person). But then something in the air stirred and this guy starts playing the trombone... okay, not bad (a little odd of an instrument choice, but I won't judge. Also, the jazzy music was pretty cool to study to.)...then another guy picks up a harmonica and mic....hmmm, interesting. Kind of folky, not bad....Annnddd then this guy starts singing and playing a guitar. Ok, seriously? Trombone, harmonica and guitar? And it seems like they are all playing three different songs. I pull up the coffee shop's website, nope, this little ""musical adventure"" is not listed on their calendar. So can random people play live music whenever or was I just privy to a special random performance? I mean it was around 4pm on a Sunday, so I wasn't expecting there to be any kind of live entertainment. 

Also, the disjointed music has now become a distraction (see, I've lost all concentration to study and started writing this review instead ::sigh::). 

3. Parking: there are like four parking spots? You have to park on the neighborhood side streets--not sure if there's a permit requirement or a free-for-all. So park at your own risk. 

4. On the plus side, the mystery cookie was pretty tasty and the coffee wasn't bad. I got the lavender mocha, it didn't really have any lavender taste (maybe they forgot it?), but I liked that it wasn't overtly sweet or syrupy. 

Overall, I'm not that impressed. If you're going to have live music--cool, just let your future patrons know through your website or some kind of sign. Also, your staff needs to get it together a little. They just seem like they're floating around, just hanging out behind the counter a little clueless.","review","tKZ-piLkevR4nYYGstFedQ",1,1,2,"Copper Star Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",7,15,4,7,20,15,8,18,12,36

I was very pleased to find this place.  It has both normal tables, and cozy, low tables with cushions vaguely reminiscent of a Japanese aesthetic.

This place really specializes in high-quality, straight loose tea.  It's a place you would go if you enjoy your tea without milk or sugar.  The menu is large and diverse.  Most importantly, the people here know how to brew tea properly--including both gong fu brewing (small, brief infusions with more leaf) and using multiple infusions western-style (longer brewing times).

The tea here is also very good quality--which, alas, is rare here in the U.S., even among specialty tea shops.  The selection is comprehensive.  You can find some esoteric teas that they don't have here if you look online, but you'll find this place carries all of the well-known teas and quite a few less-well-known ones.  In particular, there's even a good selection of oolongs, which can be hard to find in the U.S.

We had the Da Hong Pao and it was outstanding--each infusion had a totally different character.

I'm not sure why the other reviewer objected to the bells--I thought they were very cute.  There is a little bell on each table and you can ring it when you want service.

Very inexpensive to drink tea in, given how knowledgeable the staff is about brewing, and how the high-quality teas are good for making many infusions.  I definitely recommend ordering a pot.

okay all... beware of this bakery... !!!!!!   there are so many choice from home grown bakeries to franchises.  This bakery was sooo disappointing!!!!!   A wedding cake and cupcakes were ordered for a small wedding of 80 or so guests.  The flavor profiles offered were minimal and the service was at best mediocre.  Now, when a bakery states a "" mousse filling"" one would expect light fluffy and melt in your mouth.  
What was given was gritty/grainy and bitter.  When a frosting is offered as an italian meringue buttercream, it should not taste like ""grease"" or taste like it has been int he fridge for days uncovered!!!!!   The cake base was unbelievably "" dry"" .  There was a chocolate base with peanut butter mousse and a white cake with lemon mousse........  there were more uneaten cupcakes left on the table or in the trash.  The top of the wedding tower was a solitary round cake, chocolate cake with the so called buttercream frosting: it was sooo thick and tasted like grease!!!  There is even more to this... the cake was to be delivered 1 to 1.5 hours before the wedding ceremony.  the cake arrived during the wedding ceremony!!!!   The staff at the venue just threw the cupcakes on the provided stand.  The bride was so panicked: after the ceremony she was asking is the cake here.. over and over!!  She should have been focused on her special day .... 
There was absolutely no decoration on the cupcakes !!  No sugar flakes for sparkle, not even a hint of "" bling"" .  Again, I felt so bad for the bride on her special day!!

The cupcakes were good.  Were they the best cupcakes I've ever had? No, that honor still belongs to Party Favors.  The icing to cake ratio was about 3:1 which is always good in my book, but there was a faint taste in the icing that I didn't like.  It was very subtle and I'm pretty sure it was lemon.

However, my best friend, a coffee drinker, was so overjoyed with her mocha, she asked me to try it, so clearly, you'll have to sip to decide.

As we were staying at the El Cortez Hotel and Casino across the street, The Beat was a logical place to start our day. V-E-R-Y laid back atmosphere, so perhaps that's from where the negativity about service arises. While not overtly prompt, the staff with whom we dealt were both friendly and helpful, with my coke and my friend's mocha and muffin arriving within two or three minutes. The coffeehouse is base business in Vegas's Emergency Arts Center, which is a wonderfully unique combination of art-focused businesses and space, all in a converted medical facility. Only someone who dislikes art, food, coffee, people, quirky spaces and comfortable seating could find fault with all of the things contained herein, but some of these reviews led me to believe not one, but a few of those folks are out there. It's a (bleepin') locally run coffeehouse for (bleep's) sake. Calm down. Better yet, grab a cup of Joe or get something stronger at any of the many, many places on Fremont Street.

We walked past or into the place every one of our five days downtown and it was always moderately busy (busier during the morning commute and at night when live entertainment was happening). A variety of local organizations seem to host meetings here and one such group was meeting early afternoon when I stopped in to see The Burlesque Hall of Fame, which, despite the listing of hours on its door, was only open ONCE in those aforementioned five days - and even then, its hours were shortened. My only complaint about the space is directed at the BHOF, since I would gladly have toured the museum and purchased endless amounts of merchandise. This alone was my only disappointment here and has very little to do with The Beat Coffeehouse or Emergency Arts, other than asking if this was typical to the staff of the museum. Apparently it is, so CALL before visiting the BHOF, especially if you're going to make a special trip and/or aren't staying downtown.

Prices were good, the space is comfy and the jillions of records and memorabilia for show or for purchase make it a nice place to visit, even if only for 30 minutes. Locals seem to like it and that's always a good sign for me when visiting. The limited exposure we had to a performance was positive, especially when there's no cover (Vegas isn't as free as it once was, folks!), but be prepared to show ID after 8 or 9 PM. The hours make it a perfect place to drop in either early or late and the free wi-fi is definitely a plus!","review","ofiItfC04ZFOVz3F_xuRkw",2,0,3,"The Beat Coffeehouse","Coffee & Tea,Food,Bars,Pubs,Sandwiches,Nightlife,Restaurants",4,11,1,4,15,9,11,16,9,25

Myself, I am not a fan of cooking or baking so I rarely do either.  I would rather spend my time doing any number of other things than to be in the kitchen.  But I know that I can't cook.  So you will not find me selling anything that I do manage to whip up.

Anyway, when I asked the friendly young man behind the counter what the treats in the display were, he had to guess.  (It irks me so much when labels are not provided for the customer and on top of that the employee is clueless as to what baked goods s/he is actually selling.)  But it's not his fault training was not provided to him.

So I asked for what looked like a peanut butter cookie, a peanut butter reeses cup cookie, and a plain mini cheesecake.  If I could insult the baker - once again - by giving no stars, I would.  But I give one star for effort.  Bravo for trying to cook.

The cookies were refrigerator cold so that was an automatic NOrgasm.  Also there was no cookie in the cookies.  They were blobs of peanut butter chips.  I broke them in half to see the insides and both of them had a look of rawness - probably from all the fat in the peanut butter chips.  

And...um...the...um...the ? cheesecake?  What an anti-climax!  Some folks might like light and airy cheesecake with a hint of crumbly graham on the bottom.  Not me.  I don't want cheesecake to give me wings.  I want cheesecake to smack me down and hold me there.  And when I pick up cheesecake, that graham crust better pull its weight because I want to bite into it like I'm eating a sandwich.  Yes, I can have my cake and eat it too.

But I couldn't jump on these yucky treats from Krispy Creations.  They made my penis soft.  Not going there again or even suggest anyone go near.","review","Jz0Gg9rzSTm-AogWvITR2Q",0,0,1,"Krispy Creations","Food,Sandwiches,Coffee & Tea,Diners,Restaurants",3,8,3,2,7,6,6,9,16,17

I came here for an afternoon snack upon finishing a walk-through of the new PAN exhibit on show (which is amazing in and of itself) at the Frick Art Center. I wasn't expecting anything but mediocre overpriced food at the cafe, so my ""snack"" turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I split an asparagus panini with mushrooms, gruyere, and mustard with my boyfriend. The sandwich turned out to be more than enough, since it came with a side of fresh orzo salad (can't remember what was in it aside from feta, but this was delicious as well). The vegetables were incredibly fresh, which makes sense since I later discovered that all vegetables are actually GROWN ON SITE at the Frick! Brilliant.

Only bone to pick with my meal was the fact that I was unaware of the plate fee for splitting a sandwich ($3). I really didn't mind considering how tasty the panini was.

The deal was for 2 sandwiches and two pastries/desserts.  Until I saw the offer, I had no idea they even had food options but after looking over the menu online, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  My Groupon quickly expiring, I was happy to treat my Mom when she asked if I was available for lunch.

Sugar Cafe is a  modest place, and rather quiet if you pop in on a Tuesday afternoon.  My Mom selected the steak sandwich with potato salad.  I had the roasted chicken sandwich with side salad.  The wait for our food seemed a bit long considering we were the only ones waiting for food at the time.  But our sandwiches were out of this world so I was willing to forgive the extended wait for the most part.  My side salad was fresh and the dressing was great, but I was jealous of my Mom's choice of potato salad once she gave me some to try.  I was glad to have the Groupon and while I was impressed with our food, it seemed a bit pricey.  However, the $2 charge for a bottomless cup of amazing local La Prima coffee is a steal.

Having filled up on sandwiches, we picked our desserts to go.  This is where my Mom was not as impressed, mostly because she asked for the chocolate chip scone and ended up with a chocolate chip cookie (but blamed herself for not checking the bag before we left).  I got a lemon cupcake that was delicious and refreshing - a good choice for a summer day.

Friendly staff and good food made this a good choice.  I'm slowly learning that Dormont is full of great gems I have yet to discover.  Places like Sugar Cafe will keep me coming back.","review","9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg",1,0,1,"Sugar Cafe","Food,Desserts,Coffee & Tea",3,15,3,4,14,3,6,13,8,30

My hubby called off on friday so I was lucky enough that he could join me. We arrived shortly before 2, found  a parking spot right in front. Lucky us! i was wearing my sweats and felt a little under dressed but i didn't let that bother me. My money is as green as the next persons. We walked into a onslaught of bright and bubbly colors. Oranges, blues, greens and my favorite color red. We walked to the bar where a barista greeted us and asked which seat we'd prefer to sit in. I liked the high back seats at the bar so we choose to sit there. The bar itself help a  lovely grey top that kind of neutralized all the bright colors and gave it a really retro feel.

When our menu came i ordered the veggie omelette and my hubby ordered the omelette that comes with fingerling potatoes and some greens. My omelette was ok, nothing special but i could definitely taste all the fresh veggies but i guess the omelette had no salt or was cooked in cooking spray because it lacked that good egg flavor that only butter or oil can bring out. My hubbys omelette on the other hand was very good. Those fingerling potatoes tasted sooooo good. They were soft and perfectly cooked and blended into the omelette. My side dish was ciabatta bread and home fries and he ordered extra wheat toast with his greens(salad). I was sad about my potatoes because they came out cold and lacked that crispy crunch you enjoy when they are fresh. His salad was really good and came with a homemade lemon and oil dressing which i loved. Lemon is a flavor my taste buds cannot resist.

After finishing our meals we noticed a list of espresso with some really interesting combinations. We settled on the unicorn which comes with lavender and vanilla. All i can say is mmh mmmh mmmmmmhhhh!! I'm not much of a coffee drinker but this drink tasted more like a hot chocolate than coffee.

Don't come here for the coffee though, if you want good cheap coffee go to Pekara in Champaign.","review","-Yk1KPbMJGY5OkRUeo8jlw",1,1,1,"Espresso Royale","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,5,5,3,4,4,3,7,7,8

Cream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  

Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  

Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).

Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!

Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.

Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.

Thumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).

I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.

I have not had issues with waiting a long time for my drinks like other reviewers have. 

My pet peeve with this location is that they do not enforce the non-smoking ban.  The air next to the patio is bad already with the drive thru car lanes wrapping around it, but add smokers to the mix and the patio is miserable.

I dunno about that one really... but it isn't bad.  3 stars SOLELY for the quantity and quality of the beans that they have for sale here.

First things first. Dilworth has a Starbucks vibe to it... for me that is a negative... even with Steely Dan playing in the background.  What you have with Dilworth Coffee is an upgraded version of Starbucks, the only appreciable difference being that the beans are of good quality. ($6.99 for a half pound, to about $12.99 for a full pound).

Coffee culture has progressed beyond whatever Dilworth is.  I think the people that regularly frequent this place should be introduced to third wave coffee shops.  Self-serve dispensers for coffee is not ""drip coffee"" - it is crap, really.  Go to SF and visit Blue Bottle to see what I mean.  Drip coffee is prepared one cup at a time, with water poured over freshly ground beans and then served immediately.  Dilworth, where is the french press? No turkish?  What do you serve besides sickly sweet drinks and self-dispensed coffee? What's the point of fussing over the beans when you do not fuss over how you use them?

I am disappointed.  Reading the Yelp reviews made this place sound elite... and it's not.  It is a strip mall coffee shop in an affluent section of Charlotte.  Staff, I will say, is very friendly and are a credit to the business, at least from my experience today.  I think Dilworth should reevaluate what it is that they are doing and look for improvements.","review","0Xf077zYsmp13A5YtKPJ8Q",0,0,3,"Dilworth Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",6,7,4,3,4,8,4,9,14,13

For me, it's good coffee, either a savory or sweet entree, and a place where people enjoy conversations. This place meets all that and they have happy hour mimosas, bloody Mary's, and craft beer. Do I even have to add it's a 12 hour long happy hour? Oh yea, that just happened!

There's plenty of places to park, but you'd think this little place would not be able to pack all the goodies food and drinks have to offer. Well, if Reno is the biggest little city in the world, this has to be the biggest little breakfast place in Phoenix. They also have a drive thru. Can I get a woo woo?

I was not too fond of my wife's choice of the  Nutella Coffee even though many people on Yelp rave about it. I did enjoy my soy chai latte. The New Mexican burrito was flavorful on the initial bite. With the egg, spices, and meat, wow this thing is good, and it's a great portion size. My wife ordered the lox, which was salmon on top of a bagel. Lightly salted cured salmon with tomato and a fresh spread of cream cheese. Very light and tasty.

The staff looked very busy on a Saturday morning. It was our first time there, and no one greeted us or asked us to check the menu. We waited for a couple minutes and accidentally asked a customer (assumed he worked there as he fit the hipster kind of look) if we could sit ourselves down. After he said you can go ahead I realized he didn't work there, apologized, then finally asked one of the busy baristas, and was able to finally order. I will say the barista was very helpful, but busy during our order. As a result, I had to knock off one star.

Overall, what a great morning hanging with our neighbors and enjoying a meal where I felt satisfied and not over stuffed.

I docked this location one more star, down to three. The man that runs this store seems to follow whatever hours he pleases. I have now driven out to get boba a total of three times, two of which he wasn't even open (during his posted business hours), and the third of which he didn't have any boba ready. What an idiot.  Please don't make me dock you a fourth star. 

****UPDATE*****
I have demoted Lollicup by one star, sadly. They open at 10 am daily so I thought this morning, ""hey, I'll grab the boy and we'll get some boba after work this morning"". So I run home, grab they boy, and we make the trip to Avondale for some delicious milk tea. We get there around 10:10, I can hardly contain my excitement as I run up to the counter, ""two boba milk teas, please!""

....only to hear, ""Oh, no boba right now"".

 *jaw drops* 

""WHAT?! are you out? what's going on?""

""No, no, it's still cooking""

""...oookay, when will it be ready?""

""At least 11""

""ELEVEN?! Are you serious?!""

""Sorry..""

Okay, HUGE letdown. Seriously though, why the hell do you open at 10 when your product isn't ready 'til 11?! Why can't he start making it an hour earlier? I just don't understand this. At all. And I was super pissed cause I spent like $5 on gas and went home empty-handed. Seriously. Seriously. Oh! They're also closed on Mondays. So if you're in the mood for some boba, make sure it's Tuesday through Sunday AFTER 11 am.

The one issue with N√©v√© is their wifi access.  They seem to be using a low-quality router/gateway (likely one meant for use in a home).  The consistent deterioration-then-total-failure pattern of the connection today was indicative of flooded NAT tables from the underpowered router not being able to handle people using P2P file-sharing (e.g., bittorrent).  Further, the lack of being able to log on suggested DHCP saturation, for which there's little excuse when we're dealing with private IP addresses.

The downtown Barriques has its own distinct vibe, as do all the locations.  Here, the busy times give it a hustle and bustle that none of the other locations ever quite muster. It can be overwhelming to come in on a Sunday afternoon, prime homework time, and be confronted with tables piled high with law casebooks and laptops at every outlet.  

That having been said, a relaxed summer evening is a great time to drop by Barriques for a glass of wine on the outdoor patio.  The Capitol corridor streets can have a windtunnel effect, and the constant beeping of the crosswalk signal can be irritating, but with the right group and a relatively breeze-free day, the patio spot can be one of those great Madison places to see and be seen.

Inside, the coffee drinks are as consistent as they are at all Barriques locations.  The local chain scores points for their choice of Milwaukee's own Alterra coffee, which results in fine espresso beverages of all kinds.  The vibe at Barriques is laid back and mellow when you are there off-peak, and you will have your option of sunsoaked window seats or more removed seating in the balcony area upstairs.

The downsides here are the same as I mentioned in other Barriques reviews: baked goods that don't live up to the promise of the other food items and trouble getting seating at busy or peak times (based on UW campus schedules).  The upsides are many: a fine and varied selection of reasonably priced and good wines, good consistent coffee drinks, helpful and friendly staff and generally good vibes.  

Bottom line: The Barriques outlets are some of Madison's best and most reliable caf√©s and we are lucky to have so many flavors of them from which to choose.","review","7la3qalCjgbpxCEBYJOV4w",0,0,0,"Barriques","Food,Coffee & Tea",1,4,1,1,6,1,2,8,2,13

I was sceptical at first as the ordering point was chaotic and it took awhile to get an order taken but once I was served I was impressed. A tapas style board arrived with olives, tortilla and mediterrean veggies - yum and all gluten free (if the bread is not added to it). A great range of cakes is available and I was impressed there were around 5 choices of proper gluten free cake (Victoria sponge, almond cake, chocolate cakes), and not just the usual chocolate brownies.

For locals wanting to try it, I suspect a non busy time such as late afternoon mid-week would mitigate some of the issues mentioned in previous reviews but I have already recommended The Elephant House to other friends.","review","YslVzCJPQoeOwqnYduJlyQ",0,0,1,"The Elephant House","Food,Brasseries,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",3,3,0,2,2,3,0,4,7,4

I inquired as to why it didn't get brought outside like the drinks were & they said something about the tag or receipt not saying ""outside"". Really?

Ordered the root beer float, nutella, fruit loops, smores, bacon fritter, mexican, blackberry, and lemon meringue donuts with a salted caramel almond milk latte all for about $25. 

The root beer float, nutella, smores, and bacon fritter were pretty good (not pictured: the fritter and nutella because I ate them before I snapped a pic); everything else, I'd pass on. The coatings on the donuts were very melty and I wasn't too fond of the fillings in them. It was runny! Tip: have a bunch of napkins on you while eating them because I spilled all sorts of fillings on myself and had to lick my fingers off. They also have their own homemade syrups for their coffee drinks (salted caramel, vanilla, and hazelnut) but the latte I got was just alright.

I ask for a suggestion and he tells me the Italian Job is good. It has ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, lettuce, tomato, olives, and peppercini's with an Italian dressing on a sourdough. Served with a side of chips, potato salad, pickle or donut. lol 

I opt for the 1/2 sand and chili with the donut as the side. lol

At its very best, coffee is an art form. I get that. I *love* that.

But customer service is an art form, too, and it's where 21st Street Coffee and Tea falls flat. You'll get a fine coffee, but the service will leave you with the bitter aftertaste of an office kitchen's uncleaned Mister Coffee after a long weekend.

A visit to 21st begins with you placing your order by tapping the screen of an iPad located next to the cash register. The beverage menu is designed to mimic the Periodic Table of the Elements, with two-letter abbreviations representing various brews and bevs.

I couldn't find Cp or whatever the appropriate scientific abbreviation is for cappuccino. After a minute, a young barista offered to help.

""I can't seem to find cappuccino here.""

""It's there,"" came the liltingly condescending reply. 

He tapped the proper box, money was exchanged, a tip was given without the benefit of hindsight, and the happy duet of grinding beans and frothing milk began to play.

When my beverage arrived, I looked without success for the customary kiosk of sugar and stirrers.

""Excuse me, where would I find the sugar?""

""Oh, we only have one sugar bowl,"" replied another barista. ""Someone must have taken it to their table."" Glancing at my cappuccino, he added, ""Try it.""

Until milk comes from sugar cows, I'm pretty sure I'm going to want sugar in the beverage I just bought and thus own.

When the barista saw that I wasn't going to ""try it,"" he made a megaphone with his hands and shouted, ""Paging the sugar bowl! Paging the sugar bowl.""

The sugar bowl did not reply.

So I struck out on my own and found it. I added sugar to my cappuccino, which was delicious--though by this point, not quite warm enough.

If you like your coffee with a tablespoon of smug, 21st Street Coffee and Tea is for you. If you like it with a teaspoon of sugar and a dollop of courteousness, go someplace else.","review","rQ98FV8Kzh93UVol6QoyYQ",0,8,8,"21st Street Coffee And Tea","Food,Coffee & Tea",2,11,0,1,11,3,5,8,6,30

I long for the switch over to the holiday cups each season. I can go on...

I'll never forget the first time I had Starbcuks. I was in NY with my friend Cari and we were getting hot tix (student discounted tix when you show up at the butt crack of dawn) for The Full Monty. She decided if there was any way we were going to bear the cold and the line, we needed some Buck. I had never had a cup of coffee up until then, told her I was afraid of jumping in with both feet, so I got a Frapaccino, coffee's sweeter cousin... in the dead of winter... in NY.

Truth be told I don't drink Starbucks as much as I used to. Funny thing about having a job that allows me to celebrate the fine local offerings we have. However, in addition to being a remarkable brand (seriously, do some Googling if you're interested) they also have incredible boxes if you're moving and need to pack up shhhhtuff. 

This location gets 5 stars because it's by far the cleanest I've been in so far, and the staff is warm and friendly but not overly so. Large tables make it easy to gather/work and ample parking is an added bonus that some of the others don't have.","review","lC0KGXmIhyjzghBUlVnkhQ",3,2,3,"Starbucks","Food,Coffee & Tea",2,6,1,3,7,1,4,6,6,15

First, it was extremely crowded and minimal seating. There were only 3 people working and service was poor. My friend and I ordered the frittata and it came extremely runny in the middle. The eggs were barely cooked and the dish was hardly warm. We proceeded to politely tell one of the waitress and they responded telling us they were pre cooked eggs and that it shouldn't be a problem. I however do not feel comfortable eating eggs that appear runny. She then ASKED if we wanted our money back after telling her we would just leave. I'm sorry but it shouldn't have been a question if we wanted our money back, I felt they should have said we will give you your money back or you can pick another menu item for free. After waiting for another 15 minutes we were able to get refunded. again, I don't normally complain or make a scene but the service and food was a huge disappointment.","review","NUNtnS7GDTdXllVGZJiXEA",0,0,0,"Yola's Cafe","Food,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",5,3,2,1,6,6,3,6,6,9

Having heard of Artisan Roast I had a little look on the internet and decided it was the chosen one. So we headed there on a Saturday afternoon, and it was fairly quiet. She ordered her Macchiato, and I saw a lovely looking home made carrot cake, so I ordered a slice, and a cappuccino. I find that way of ordering/paying a little confusing, but we took a seat in the comfy seating out the back - using cafetieres for lights - i LOVED the idea! 

So once our coffees arrived, my honest first impression of my double shot cappuccino - that is awfully small! But....... it is not all about quantity. I expected it to be good, but it surpassed what I had imagined, just the right balance of coffee and milk, and no silly chocolate on the top, they totally let the coffee do the talking, and I loved it. And the obligatory cake -  delicious, moist and the cream cheese topping was just sweet enough.

We weren't ever greeted or said goodbye to.  The first thing the cashier said to me when I went up to order was just ""hold on."" Then she took my order (medium tea), then told me to hold on again, so she could finish doing two other orders, one of which was a smoothie. I literally just ordered tea and their tea comes in tea bags. She just left my cup with a tea bag in it on the counter while she went to make the coffee and the smoothie. Maybe it's just me, but I don't see why she couldn't just put the hot water in my cup.

I do understand that it must've been hard since she was the only one working up front, but c'mon, you gotta learn how to multitask and do it with a smile on your face. If she at least greeted us or said something other than ""hold on"" and ""here you go"" to me, then I might've given this place 3 stars, maybe even 4.

I have passed Grouchy John's just about every Mon-Fri on my way from the office to the gym and never really gave it thought till today and my Yelp check for a nearby place ran me here because of the reviews. 

And now i too have become a fan. I type this from one of the very comfortable couches that fills the interior and makes you feel very comfortable to chill out, work, or converse with friends over a good cup of Joe. The interior is a little funky but friendly with a wall full of books, unique art, and a Star Wars toys wut! The staff is uber friendly and welcoming when i entered. I mentioned my usual order at CBTL and asked if they could do something similar which is just a coffee with chocolate powder and they did it here with syrup (no charge) and it was perfect. I cant say that the coffee is anything any more spectacular than what i have had at other locations around town but i can say that i like the feel of the layout, the comfort of being able to sit and not be bothered to GTFO anytime soon, and of course the WiFi allows me to do my work my work.Service goes a long way with me, and friendliness never hurt anybody so i will certainly be spending my money here again when i want to venture out of my cave (office) and people watch while having a cup. 

Note... they had a picture of a damn bowl of oatmeal i will have to check out next time in here for only a couple of bucks. If it wasn't taco Tuesday and id feel id ruin my appetite i would have done that for sure cause i sure looked tasty. 

Also i had a young lady sit next to me the entire time i was here and just came in for the free WiFi, never bought a thing. Im sure your simply trying to be nice but i think a password or code for the WiFi would be a good idea so you dont have people doing this constantly. I always make sure i have something while im in a business like this because they are providing me a service so the least i can do is spend my money for what their offering...its only fair.","review","xtj_4U6CdlIfmgcLGai2kg",0,0,0,"Grouchy John's Coffee Shop","Food,Coffee & Tea",6,22,4,6,16,4,11,19,6,24

Not the best but much better than some other places, and when it's made like soy, it still tastes spicy and delicious (unlike a chai I had at Cartel which tasted purely like soy, super disappointing). I haven't tried their Avalanches yet, but I really want to, they look really good. Prices are decent too, about $5 for a medium chai and a delicious muffin. 

I think the decor is cute too, looks like it belongs up north in Flagstaff or Sedona.

A dark little cafe next to the new Pita Pit and Cafe Rio, 3pm Cafe offers boba drinks, teas, smoothies and Taiwanese snacks and entrees.  The tables are unique with corner-shaped chairs.  Wifi is free: the phone number!  There are lots of outlets so you can hang out and study.  The hours are good, early to late and great for the nearby student.

I stopped in for lunch today and experienced great service.  I ordered one tea-flavored egg ($1.50, 3 are $3.25), a fried tofu appetizer, and an off-the-menu avocado boba smoothie.  The smoothie came first in a huge mason jar - I ordered the regular but it almost appeared like mine was large!  It is more sweet tasting than avocado tasting, but still good.  Next time I should go for almond milk tea because that is another favorite of mine.

The tea flavored egg came next.  I peeled it (I am terrible at hard boiled egg peeling but this was at least cracked for me in the kitchen).  Unraveling the shell bits was an almost tie-dyed egg, a beautiful contrast of brown shades.  It was a bit salty, and the yolk over hard (I am partial to eggs without grey-shrouded yolks) but it was a new experience nonetheless and not bad.

Lastly, the tofu appetizer.  Mini fried and marinated tofu squares with salt and pepper sprinkled on top.  Tasty and simple.  With the drink, definitely filling.  The server graciously put my mason jar smoothie into a to go cup.  I will definitely come back again.  There are also daily specials and this week a 10% off discount with RebelCard.","review","bCLFdVfkAiZ7t1xDskb66Q",4,3,5,"3pm Cafe","Food,Coffee & Tea,Cafes,Japanese,Restaurants",4,7,3,4,6,5,6,7,5,13

This place has an excellent vibe to it like any great coffeehouse should.  I generally don't have time to get my coffee to stay, so I've not really had the chance to spend some time relaxing at a table or out on the porch - too bad on my part.  My usual routine is to walk in, grab a couple pounds of bulk beans, then fill up my traveler and get my punchcard stamped and pay.  On a good day I'm in and out within ten minutes.  In addition to coffee and bulk beans there's a small pastry case that has pre-wrapped items that can be either prepared there or taken with.  The breakfast burritos are pretty good, but my favorite is the spinach-stuffed croissant.  In addition to the usual coffee card (buy 10 get 1) they offer a bulk card - buy 5 lbs. and get a half pound free.  

Parking can sometimes be a bit of a concern - yesterday I ended up circling the block searching for a spot.  It's located just up from Miller's and there aren't a ton of parking stalls in the lot, but during the summer the bike racks seem to be always full so keep that in mind if you're local.  Given the fact there was no parking I shouldn't have been surprised to see a long line of customers upon entering.  I don't generally order special coffee drinks but I do believe the baristas at Tuvalu may not be the quickest at turning around orders.  This doesn't usually concern me, but I did get stuck in line for the better part of fifteen minutes yesterday.

Aside from the coffee-related offerings I've found a good number of last-minute gifts at Tuvalu.  They've got a decent assortment of glass and pottery items crafted by local and international artists.  I've gotten a few really great presents just on a whim, including a set of hand-blown glass coasters and a tea set.  There's always FTO chocolate bars as well, just waiting for an impulse buy.  I also get pure Wisconsin maple syrup from Cazenovia, which even comes in a mapleleaf-shaped bottle - it's one of my father's favorite things and tastes especially good on buckwheat pancakes.  I've never gone here for lunch as I'm usually passing through Verona on my way down to my parents' place, but the sandwich specials advertised on the board by the counter have always looked pretty good.  Some day I'm sure I'll find out for certain, but until then I'll keep coming back for the excellent coffee.","review","uSlKnryLlnD3mvmG6DIyCg",1,1,1,"Tuvalu Coffehouse & Gallery","Coffee & Tea,Shopping,Food,Arts & Crafts,Sandwiches,Restaurants",3,15,1,2,17,2,8,22,6,25

Very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour.  The service was friendly - you go up to the counter, order your food and they bring it out to you, you grab your own drinks - it's not the type of place where you're being waited on.  

The restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together, I thought that was nice because you don't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal.

It was basically a large plate of a hot brown bean stew with salad accompaniment and some flat bread on the side. Simple and basic, not too inspiring, but tasty enough and under a tenner.

A throwback to the pre-Starbucks coffeehouses.  

The bread is the star, and the fresh, quality ingredients.  My wife had the roasted veggie sandwich.  Roll was hard and chewy, so have your good set of teeth firmly in place.  I had the croque monsieur with a side of lightly dressed greens.  Absolutely delicious.

Their pastry case is situated so the product stands out and screams bright and shiny at you.  It looked like a good idea!

We each ordered one delicious looking morsel then took a seat in the crowded walkway to eat our snack.  

The problem is, these pastries (or at least the two different ones we ordered) are ""engineered"" for their looks and longevity in the pastry case and not the flavor and texture of the product.  

Both the caramel mousse and the cheesecake had a thick sticky gelatin disk laid on top.  At first I thought it was plastic, and tried to peel it off.  It made the surface shiny and glimmering under the lights, but was a thick sticky gummy mess when trying to eat the thing.  

On top of the cheesecake too?  Sure enough this thick gelatin made to keep the thing glistening under the lights was put on top of the cheesecake too.  It changed the flavor and texture.   

The caramel mousse had APPLES inside of it.  I was sorely disappointed in it, as I could not understand apple pie filling in my caramel mousse.  (Pic)

The cheesecake tasted like standard freezer cheesecake to me, but add that rubbery disk on top and forget it.  Nasty.

This Korean owned cafe is so unique. First off is their interior. When you walk in you get this antique roadshowish type of vibe. There are trinkets and accessories everywhere in the cafe. There are a variety of rad chairs, benches, and a couch. The jewel of this place is the Volkswagen tent up front. Inside the tent are 4 comfy bean bag chairs, a table, Christmas lights, and fake grass underneath you. You'd be lucky if it's empty! This place also has free wifi!

When you order drinks you are given a pile of pictures to choose from as a stamp card. Another unique trait is that this cafe has a stamp card rack. You put your name on your stamp card and hang it under a letter of your choosing. After 7 stamps your next drink is free!

Their menu is also eye candy. Everything on their menu is under $9. The most expensive thing on there is snow ice for $8. Drinks range from $2-$5. They have plenty of coffees, teas, and cold drinks to choose from. I've tried the cold chai tea latte ($3) and the green tea frappe ($5). They both have strong flavors and that's what makes it taste great. You get the strong taste of matcha and the strong taste of chai. They both come in cute cups that look like they could be from urban outfitters. I'm willing to try the whole menu!

Our dinners were carried out two at a time (there were eight of us), with several minutes between each arrival.  After at least ten minutes, one person's dinner still hadn't arrived, and no one was checking on us.  We had to flag down a server, who told us our original server's shift had ended and we'd been handed over to someone else and not informed.  She checked with the kitchen and the absent meal HAD been on the order...the kitchen had just neglected to make it, and the servers in a not-busy restaurant hadn't noticed.  My friend said that was ok, whatever, but they brought her out some cobbled-together version and took the meal off the bill.

My French toast was ok, too eggy.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dinners for the most part, for what the food was.  The banana bread that came with the fruit salad lacked banana.","review","mSNh2eJ5S9o2xztDbPwftg",1,1,2,"Teahouse","Food,Coffee & Tea",2,4,2,1,4,4,1,4,4,6

Customer service was always grand and staff was always knowledgeable of their menu and able to make good recommendations. For me, some of the signature drinks like the Grouchy John are unfortunately just too sweet for my palate, but with a very wide variety and a willingness from staff and ownership to please, it is easy to find a beverage that you'll keep coming back to. And if you do not like your drink, whether it was made wrong or you just discovered it's not for you, they will remake it or give you something else to make you happy.

So for me, I recommend the Butter-Me-Up Late which is made with cookie butter but to me tastes like cereal milk if you're into that kind of thing. Also I love the Jedi and for a break from coffee, they make a superb apple cider with caramel and cinnamon add-ins if you like. Pastries, cookies, bagels, etc. are also delicious, but sometimes when they bring in merchandise from other shops in town it can be overpriced- but this makes sense considering the change of hands. That aside, this is one of the only places I know that really does cross-promote other local shops and bakeries in a wonderful way and Grouchy Johns seems to be the most involved in the community with their Thursday night networking (I forget the official name), clothing and toys drives, and more. Also, love the decor and their displays you can buy especially from local artist Tommy Vinci- very cool.

I would easily recommend this place to anyone. I used it primarily as a study ground, alone or with friends. The only thing is it is busy a lot of the time because it is really popular, so if you go there to study either bring headphones or adapt to a ""white noise"" environment. My only complaint is that I wish it could be open later more often for the night owls among us :) Maybe some day!","review","_WzIZ4V0Z8h5uR7wufVkXA",0,0,0,"Grouchy John's Coffee Shop","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,7,2,2,9,3,4,12,8,25

My go-to drink at the moment is their Strawberry Milk Slush with Extra Sugar and Herbal Jelly. The first time I got this drink, it wasn't as sweet as I liked - so I made sure to order it with extra sugar next time. Some days they make my drink spot on. Other days my drink will end up tasting like they didn't put any sugar at all, or they put just the normal sugar amount. I've also had days where there would be very little herbal jelly in my drink. 

I know that they always offer to make adjustments to my drink after it has been made. However, I always have my son with me, so I'm not able to taste my drink right away. I usually have to wait until I get back to my car and put my son in his car seat to do so. By the time I realize that my drink wasn't made properly, it's too much of a hassle for me to go back inside and have them correct it. 

I really like this place. I just wish they were more consistent with their drinks.

What a great find. Nestled as the back of Hotel St Denis is this charming locale. So perfect in every way. Self and boy friend popped in one mid week morning in early November around 8:30am, I believe that it stays open until 10pm. Just one or two other customers. Our highly entertaining, engaging and thoroughly skillful Barista gave us a wonderful experience.  Shame I didn't ask for his name. We placed our order for a cappuccino and a drip coffee as well and accepted his recommendation for the most scrumptious sweet potato muffin and delicious almond croissant and were asked to take a seat. Now knowing that artisanal coffee takes time we were really taken in with the ambiance and vibe of Cafe St Henri. The photos on Yelp will give you a perfect birds eye view of the restaurant's interiors.

Soon enough our Barista served up our coffees and pastries, along with cute glasses filled with good water and linen napkins. Because he wasn't so busy just then we were able to engage in conversation with him relating to third wave coffee in Montreal versus our hometown of NYC. He explained the history behind the coffee used at the cafe and the roasting. And just like a previous Yelp Reviewer mentioned, coffee made in small batches is truly coffee at its best.

We fell in love. You just couldn't help it. Everything that should be right about a coffee experience was there at Cafe St Henri. It's so worth putting on your schedule to stop in when in Montreal and if you're a local who hasn't yet been? Well, you are missing out....

But let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to ""look in the back"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.

To be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.

I had decided to come here one day with a close friend to grab lunch before work. we were extremely hungry and had heard good things so decided to give it a try. 

First of all, it has the most AWFUL smell to to store. Once I walked in I lost my appetite because that smell was horrific. then they handed us a menu and I had explained I had never been there before. the menu was very small and extremely confusing. she had us sit down just to get back up again and give our order up into the front, and sit back down AGAIN. 
when we had first came up to the line the man behind the counter yelled at us saying we went to the wrong line. it was very rude. the girl who took our order has multiple facial piercings, which I didn't like because it they were trying to represent themselves as a classy restaurant. 

i got the ""first time"" crepe which was Nutella and banana and my friend got a creame strawberry crepe. it cost about $7 each which was outrageous compared to the other crepe places we have tried. 

we couldn't even stand the smell so we chose to sit outside in the 90 degree weather. although no one was really there (mind you it was a lunch time so that was odd), our food took a while. while sitting in the heat outside the facial piercings girl brought us 3 sweet potato chips ""on the house"". it was very embarrassing that they thought that was a good appetizer and the chips weren't good at all. finally we got our food after 15 minutes. 

IT WAS HORRIBLE. there were 3 mini crepes, and I mean very mini. not worth $7. it was nothing special at all. my friend and I were still very hungry afterward and ended up walking to the croissant restaurant next door and spent the rest of our time there.

From the outside looks of the Edinburgh Larder, it seemed like a quaint and authentic place to eat, so we decided to give it a try for late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we walked inside, each of the employees not only greeted us with a huge smile but seemed genuinely interested in where we were traveling from, giving us advice on where to visit during our time in Edinburgh. They were the epitome of hospitable and friendly to us and all the other customers, so the service was phenomenal. Nay, it was incomparable, and really set the bar high for the rest of our UK interactions. 

Now, as for the food, my friend and I went straight for their cheese plates with pumpkin chutney and oatcakes. The Thistly Cross cider was also highly recommended, so we turned this late lunch/early dinner into an all-out feast. The food is sourced from all over Scotland, and I can't speak highly enough about the quality. The staff is so knowledgeable about what they're serving and how they're preparing it that, well, I wish I could eat there every day (which my friend and I did while we were in Edinburgh). Also, Thistly Cross is pretty much the most dangerously delicious adult beverage I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, so I need to figure out where I can get my hands on it in the States. 

We ended up eating there twice more during our stay, and both of those times were for breakfast. It doesn't get any better than being greeted first thing in the morning by the friendliest people in Scotland. Plus, the clotted cream and jam is always the way to go! I can't thank the Edinburgh Larder and its staff for such a memorable and enjoyable first (but definitely not last) trip to Edinburgh. 

Side note to prove that the employees there are the best, love their job, and you should go there immediately if you're in Edinburgh: My friend and I were visiting in early March and the entire cafe was filled with fresh-picked daffodils. I asked who was responsible for hand picking all the flowers and, sure enough, one of the employees, Chris, had picked them all and filled the cafe with them. The Edinburgh Larder, staff, Chris and his daffodils: you all are national treasures!","review","w4yNT07U2NKIO79yOOk2qQ",0,0,0,"The Edinburgh Larder","Food,Delis,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants",2,7,1,2,17,5,4,16,6,39

They do their bubbles amazingly well, I would say the best I have had in Madison, and comparable to the Chinatown bubble tea in Chicago and California. Their bubbles have a certain chewiness to them, not too hard and not too soft, just right! With a little tinge of sweetness to them. My favorite drinks are the matcha green tea unsweetened, I like that unsweetened, and with the added pearls in the drink, the sweetness is just right. They are also very good at customizing sugar levels, and so I could order another of my favorite drink, taro milk tea, at the half sugar level.

I really like the tea they have here. I usually always get the mixed fruit tea, which is a mix of different fruits steeped to flavor your beverage. The tea is really good and comes out piping hot, so it kinda forces you to spend some time there. The place is cool, and they serve things other than tea. They have boba, shaved ice-type things, and other things I haven't gotten around to trying yet. Plus, the prices are right, though I dislike that I have to spend $20 or more to use plastic.

Dutch Bros. Coffee was founded by 2 brothers, who happen to have a Dutch heritage. 
My kinsmen, both geographically and nordicly:)
They are from, of all places, Grants Pass, Oregon (do not snooze on the drive up I-5 or you will miss Grants Pass...actually, don't snooze while you're driving that section of I-5...you'll drive off a mountainside and miss some of the most spectacular scenery in the United States, because you'll have crashed).
Dutch Bros. are still headquartered in Grants Pass. That seems like a pretty small town for a couple of guys who own a business like this, but I bet it doesn't seem small if you have a jet to get out of town...and I bet old Travis and Dane have a jet because they've sold an ocean of coffee over the past few years!
Boy, do we know our coffee in the great northwest, or what (oh I know, I haven't lived up there for 15 years and it takes a threat of physical force to get me to go back to the ranch these days, but I still like to claim the place for something more than the rain:)
After my run this morning, I had to go pick up my mail (and can anybody tell me why they moved my PO Box from the very convenient Osborne location to North Tempe?...it's about a 45 minute drive down there and back).
And what do you want more than anything else after running 5 miles in 90 degree heat? That's right...a cup of piping hot coffee.
I pulled into the drive through and said ""set me up"", then I got to the speaker and had to say it again.
They got my coffee right the first time (right sweetener, right cream...it's why I almost never use drive through for coffee, but these guys made me happy).
And best of all, it's good coffee!

Came here twice for brunch & dinner and both times? AWESOME. It's on the pricier end, but you get what you pay for. For dinner I tried the tasting menu (60$) and turns out they change their tasting menu quite often. Every week I think. Anyway it was 6 course meal and boy was I full and satisfied. Some of my courses included a panna cotta (sp?) for dessert, tofu pocket, 1865 beef, salmon tuna ceviche, cauliflower soup etc Honestly, you won't be disappointed with the tasting menu, but prepare to spend at least 70-80 for that. I highly recommend ordering the sushi, I find it's their signature. So don't expect Kanda/Tokyo/Odaki kind of sushi. I'm talking high-end quality sushi here. For brunch I tried a more regular menu. I ordered a bibimbap and my friend ordered a kim chi B.L.T. I wished I ordered the kim chi B.L.T but I have a soft spot for bibimbap. I tried the other dish as well as my own and both were spectacular. The bibimbap was sweet and spicy, tasted really healthy. I believe the rice was brown and the portion size was just right.  The B.L.T was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life. Great combination with egg kimchi bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. I had a mediocre smoothie though. But that's fine, they dont specialize in smoothies anyways. I am definitely a fan and will be a regular. Highly recommend the tasting menu. Oh and make sure to reserve!

PS My only complaint is the waiters/waitresses need to improve their service more for example being more knowledgeable with their food, less redundant when explaining the menu, and being more natural. I found that one of the waiters that was serving me the third time I came, to be a very unnatural and came off a bit fake.","review","3MefpVDMrX156wOTBGAygg",4,0,6,"Restaurant Park","Bakeries,Coffee & Tea,Specialty Food,Food,Asian Fusion,Health Markets,Restaurants",2,7,3,2,8,1,3,12,7,22

An actress is probably not the best person to accompany one to afternoon tea. Cakes are probably the nemesis of those in the 'biz'. But what my friend Lindsey Lee lacks in experienced face-stuffing she makes up for in entertainment value; I am sure I got an abs workout from laughing so hard.

This was handy and I had ordered 'The Full Monty'; Afternoon Tea for Two if you please. And at ¬£8.50 a pop it was superb value for money. 

The teas are from Love Loose Teas and we sampled Perky Peppermint, Chocolate Peppermint and Ginger. All were stunningly fresh tasting and served in quaint glass pots. 

We had chosen teas to aid digestion because the Afternoon Tea is a vertiginous mountain of finger sandwiches, tray bakes, cakes and sweet and savoury scones. The smoked salmon with cream cheese was luscious. The simple addition of dill was a welcome attention to detail that is so complementary you wonder why others don't follow suit. Egg, chicken and ham sandwiches were equally good and outstanding for their generous fresh and tasty fillings. Lindsay had a savoury cheese scone which she loved despite the fact that she had distractedly spread clotted cream on it!

Up to the second layer of the stand which contained carrot cake, chocolate and beetroot brownie, yoghurt and cranberry tray bake and millionaire  shortbread. And yes you heard me correctly we are still only on the second layer! The yoghurt and cranberry slice had a nice crisp base with plenty of fruit, the shortbread was dreamy with soft caramel, the brownie made perfectly moist and dark by the beetroot; a generous slice of carrot cake in no way disappointed. 

Our top layer of treats consisted of scones with cream and jam but we had asked for a doggy bag. 

This little caf√© is perfectly charming. From the paintings on the walls, the gifts, the display of cakes and treats and the friendly service from Brad, our waiter for the afternoon. Caf√© Musa is perched at the top of the mound but just back from the hubbub. This makes it a peaceful haven although slightly hard to find.

First off I'm not really impressed with anything about this shop.  Entering the shop the girl greeted me but then hospitality fell off immediately. They should take a trip the dutch brothers coffee shop for a lesson on how to chop up a conversation. Three employees and none really engaged or seem like they even wanted to talk or sell me anything... I mean first off its a retail store. Try to sell me stuff or inform me of the new products or something. 

I'm not a bike expert or enthusiast but I'm intuitive and understand how a bike works. So when I bought an add on to tension my chain, which saves me a world of frustration when I flip to fixie, the dude stuck it on so absolutely crooked. It didn't fit in the groove and was held on by 3 threads at most. When I took it back he was like ""its super tight and will not move an where."" I'm just thinking wtf, it was design specifically to fit in the slot so that you can fasten the nut all the way. I told him does it looks like the chain is too short and replacing that would fix the problem. He say yeah it would. Wtf, then bring that up when you initially installed. I'm about to spend $150 on tires do you think a $15 chain would be out of the question and that I would prefer my wheels be held on by 20% of available thread?? Geez man! 

I might now have a thousand dollar bike but geez I'm still a customer and you shouldn't half-@ss work on my bike. Anyways.

The second time I went into Black Medicine I was in dire need of caffeine before a lecture. The barista seemed to have completely ignored my request to have my cappuccino takeaway and snapped at me for asking later on to put it in a takeaway cup.

The store was understaffed with 2 people.  The shelves are empty with very limited selections.  The person over charged me because he didn't understand the promotion they are running.  When I demanded to speak with the manager for a refund, she unwillingly processed the refund in a rude manner.  I was abandoned for 15 minutes waiting for my order that they never even bother to prepare.  
At last, I demanded a full refund and walked out.  Wasted 20 minutes of my time with no food or coffee.

for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.

fresh ingredients, so good.

My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.

they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls.

After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here.  We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market.  I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.

As we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter.  We joined the line and read the menu.  Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir.  As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my husband that maybe I should snag a table.  I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first.  I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw.  I sat for several minutes, watching my husband inch his way up to the counter.  A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line.  I said yes.  She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table.  I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables.  I said okay, but I held on to my table.  So that part was a little stressful.  The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table.  Thankfully my husband was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.

We sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides.  We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.

Our food came and it was delicious!  The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy.  The caprese salad was very tasty.  We devoured every last bite.

The best part?  You can do it at any time.  This cozy little spot is open 24 hours a day and if you somehow happen to end up in the mood for one of their red velvet mochas or a ""More Cowbell"" sandwich at 3 a.m., then fret not, for your solution is down the road.

The Only downside? The second MadHouse spot, off of Eastern and Pebble stays open from 6 a.m. - 10 p.m., but that's still good enough for most.

The atmosphere of MadHouse certainly lives up to its namesake -- or at least the interior decorations do.

Ranging from bizarrely painted tables to hairy lampshades hanging from above and a very odd rendering of the Mona Lisa, even the hookah placed off on a shelf adds to it all. I'm only left wondering where the Cheshire cat has run off to.

The best part of MadHouse comes in the form of their decadently delicious drinks. I had the ""Monkey Mocha"", which is made up of a blend of peanut butter, banana and mocha, then topped with whipped cream and some chocolate syrup. Yes, it was just as perfect as it sounds.

Other indulgent offerings are on the menu as well, ranging from the red velvet mocha to the ""Mad Cow,"" a hazelnut latte.

Since the coffee shop also emphasizes its bakery and sandwich creations, I decided to give one a try and went with the ""Island of Capri."" Featuring the wholesome goodness of focaccia bread, freshly sliced mozzarella, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and oregano, I suddenly felt like I was at some cafe off the coast of Italy, before looking out the window and remembering the sad truth  of, well, being stuck in Vegas.

While there isn't much space for studying, nor any tables fit for a large group study session, this is the perfect spot to quickly grab a drink (its drive-thru equipped!) at any time of day, and if you're hungry too, well, look no further.

Ive been to coffee shops all throughout the country and this is definitely one of the best. A great alternative to all the 'roided up bars in the Southside area.

My friend and I get along with everyone there -- most of the staff even know us on a first name basis! -- and each time they are able to recommend something to us based on our personal tastes, which they all seem to have a mental catalog of. 

It's a quaint shop for its vast size; the window walls make everything seem more open and friendly, and the fact that you get to see them roast their own beans in small batches really makes you feel like you're one with the shop. They have a small menu drink-wise, but there are still so many combinations to mix. And food-wise? Might I suggest the Pressed Italian sandwich or the Asian salad!

I personally prefer their Chai Tea Latte over the competitors because they actually use real tea.  Most places make Chai Tea with a pump or two of sugared syrup.  But the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf makes it the way it should be made, and the difference is in the taste.

They also have a large extra meeting room in the back of the already spacious building.  Some times special events such as casting calls and poetry readings are hosted in here.

The whole way there, I'm thinking I have been here before, and not until we pulled up did I realize we came here a few years back when it was It's A Grind. From what I remember, it's definitely changed. It's a fairly small spot and even though it's a little hipsterish, I dig the art on the walls and some of the quirky little knick-knacks lining the counter.

The menu here is pretty big and naturally, the first thing that caught my eye was the mention of Nutella in multiple items. They've got quite a few unique items too like mocha frappes in Cake Batter, Red Velvet and my pick, the Monkey Mocha, which is peanut butter and banana. While both the peanut butter and banana flavor were really good in the drink, it was a way too watered down for me. The wifey had the Cake Batter Mocha and it was so insanely sweet, I don't even know how she drank it. I also got what they call the Nutellamisu and wasn't a huge fan. It didn't taste anything like Nutella and I think it may have been old. It was ok, but the taste just wasn't right and the ladyfinger portion of it was super soggy.

My biggest reasoning for the two stars is the employees. Whenever I go somewhere that has an open kitchen or whatever you call it in a coffee shop, I tend to watch what everyone's doing. Not because I want to nitpick, but because I'm legitimately interested and intrigued by what goes on back there. So, as I'm sitting there watching the two people back there work, I notice the girl keeps eating food behind the counter. And she kept doing that thing where when you eat something crumbly, you're almost putting your fingers in your mouth to catch it. Well, after she does that...she goes right to making something else and touching other food that was for a customer in the drive thru. Coupled with their not so friendly attitudes, it seemed weird and gross to me that she's back there eating, but not washing her hands. It was enough for me not to want to try anything else on the menu, including the sandwiches, which looked pretty good too by the way.

Prices aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. A medium blended drink will set you back about $6, which made our total bill just under $18 with two mochas and the Nutellamisu. For me, there was very little to like here and unless I was in the area at some weird hour craving coffee, I probably won't be coming back.","review","T3ISRzQ1fQPkUANyokIgAw",4,5,7,"MadHouse Coffee","Food,Bakeries,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",4,11,5,5,9,3,8,9,8,18

This is why we think of chocolate as a luxury item.

Hotel Chocolat does nothing to dispel the view of chocolate as a luxury item - although its prices mean it's a luxury most of us will be able to afford!

After a wonderful event last night, I can't see anyone who goes into Hotel Chocolat giving it less than 5 stars.  

The cafe is at the back of the chocolate shop itself - and when I say ""chocolate shop"" I mean chocolate heaven.  Or hell, if you have to actually make a choice.  It was almost overwhelming, the walls of wonderful varieties and old favourites (but all with a far better standard of chocolate), but eventually the inspired thought hit me....I could always come back next week.   ....Or sign up for their monthly tastings...

Mental note:  must renew gym membership!

Actually, on that note, I tried their cocoa infusion, which was like chocolate tea, only not like tea at all (thank goodness!) - but it wasn't as rich as some of the other items on the menu and, as such, it didn't feel like too much of a marvellous thing. 

I'm dying to know how Jurgen's chocolate rubbing concoction goes, and I'm tempted to try out the cocoa pasta.

Whatever the recipe in our own kitchens, I'm looking forward to making my way through the Hotel Chocolat menu.  The variety, the price, the friendly staff all make an experience guaranteed to be sweet.","review","MgzpVUdiKXfSVzg-Nbm8TQ",0,0,1,"Hotel Chocolat","Food,Specialty Food,Coffee & Tea,Chocolatiers & Shops",3,11,2,2,15,3,5,13,4,23

Probably the strangest bistro I've ever been to, but that's not the problem. I am usually a big fan of strange. The interior is confused, mixing vintage with urban decor in a spacious informal environment. There are couches and board games trying to marry a modern dining experience. 

The service is slow and the menu is 'seasonal' which is often code for 'limited'. In this case it is, with lunch being difficult for those who aren't fans of fish or pork. Though hear the vegetarian options are nice, they are expensive. In fact, you won't leave this place without shelling out a good  ¬£15 easy (with a drink), for a mediocre lunch and a chance to sit at a 'cool' wooden table. Plus the portions are pretty small and not hugely filling. I don't mind spending a bit extra for locally inspired, creative food, but it should make an impact and I don't find that to be the case here.

I had oil and grease all over the front and back of my shirt from adding gear oil to the transmission from underneath the Bug.  I had just finished adding the gear oil and asked my mother if she would like to go with me while I took it for a test drive.  She agreed and off we went.

Since this Starbucks is close to my mother's house we decided that it would be a perfect place to take it for a test drive.

I pulled up to the drive-thru and ordered the drinks by opening the driver side door as the window gets off track if it is rolled down.  My mother ordered a Grande Hot White Mocha without whip cream and I ordered a Grande Salted Caramel Mocha (Delish!!!).  The very nice and kind Barista taking the order told me the price, I closed the door, pulled up behind the person in front of me to wait my turn to get to the drive-thru window when I realized I had left my wallet at home.  Since I was working on the Bug, I didn't want it getting in the way while I was under the car.  I felt really bad.  I didn't know what to do except tell the Barista that I didn't have the money with me, explain why, and come back with it.  We didn't live that far away anyway.

When I got to the window, I opened the door, showed the Barista my soiled shirt, explained that I just was taking the Bug for a test drive since I just worked on it and forgot my wallet.  He told me not to worry about it and that he would give me the drinks anyway.  I was taken by surprise.  He wanted to give us the drinks anyway even though we couldn't pay for them.  Wow!  I told him that I felt really bad and wanted to refuse, but the drinks were already made and they would have just been thrown out anyway, so we took the drinks and I promised to come back with payment.  We got our drinks, I closed the door and I started to drive the bug out of the parking lot when I realized I had my Samsung Galaxy S5 with me.  I have my Starbucks Gold Card linked to the Starbucks app on my phone and I have money on the card.  I realized I could have paid with the app all along, so I quickly turned around, went inside, (all greasy and oily) and told the Barista at the drive-thru and the shift supervisor on duty (I believe it was Kyle), that I realized I could pay with my phone.  

The shift supervisor, (again, I think his name is Kyle) told me that since I came back in that he would comp one of the drinks, and again I was completely surprised!  I didn't expect this at all as all of this was my fault anyway, but still I received excellent customer service from the entire team.  My mother and I enjoyed our drinks and an exceptional experience at this Starbucks!  

I want to thank Lyn, the store manager, for training his team so well.  Lyn and Fish have always treated me with the exceptional, legendary service that made Starbucks a great company.   Thank you too, Kyle (I hope that's your name), for going the extra step to make me feel great despite the entire incident being my fault.
You and your team are exceptional!

Going to the strip for coffee is just to far out of my way.

They brought it to my table which was nice, I didn't have to stand around waiting to pick up my order, or hear my name; and they brought it to me in a ceramic mug, which gave it an extra nice touch! It was heaven in a cup, very delicious! I also got a chocolate croissant. They warmed it up in the oven and it was very tasty and complimented my mudhouse hot chocolate fabulously! My sister tried there new peppermint bark , which is made with white chocolate and peppermint. She isn't a peppermint fan, but loves white mocha, so she gave it a try. She loved it, it was rather sweet but says she would order it again. They also brought that over in a ceramic mug with whip cream and candy cane sprinkles! She had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, I had a bite it was so warm and tasty. The bread was very soft!  We are defenitely  making this our spot. The owner came over and introduced himself, and all the staff was really nice, they seem to enjoy what they do and were great with welcoming us and making suggestions, cause in a new place I don't always know what I want.

Vegas is actually pretty reasonable and not crowded and you can get good/decent service at most establishments when you run on business time rather than on party time.  I ate here recently while staying at TI during a work trip (seriously...people do go to vegas for reasons other than partying).

Anyways, my boss and I stopped in for breakfast before checking out on our last morning.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The portions were big, but not outrageously so. Good value (of course). Not too greasy. Above average diner food. 

The boss had french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast came with all the fixings - powdered sugar, syrup and butter.  Boss-lady enjoyed her morning heart attack meal.  The waitress only flinched once when she asked for MORE powdered sugar to accompany the already powder-white french toast.  

I had a standard 2-eggs, bacon, hash brown and toast meal.  Everything was pretty good for what it is. It was surprisingly (pleasantly so) not overly greasy. I was pleased to find my scrambled eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked, and not covered in grease. The bacon was also crispy and not too greasy (I wonder if they are actually cooking their bacon in the oven and letting the fat drip off).  Toast was standard. Nothing was overcooked which is surprising in this day and age of hypochondriacs and under-developed food palettes. The coffee was a tinge stronger than one would expect.

Prices were fair (although my boss did complain that her side of bacon was about $8...but she did get like 6 or 7 pieces of bacon with that order...which seems fair since most places charge $2-3 for a side of bacon with 2 pcs).

The service was good. We never had to ask for coffee refills. Out waitress was nice enough.  She wasn't speedy but wasn't slow either. No complaints here.

They have one of the best iced coffees in Phoenix and I love their farm egg sandwich. However, I was there today for a mid day meeting and figured I would try their lunch. I ordered the pear, arugula melt flatbread. The description sounded yummy, but it didn't live up to the menu at all. First of all, it was so drenched in the balsamic glaze that I couldn't really taste anything else. I didn't taste or see any pears at all (but my be due to the massive amount of balsamic glaze) and there was hardly any arugula on the flatbread- seemed more like a garnish than part of the dish.

The service was really lacking today. I think they were training 2 new people and the they seemed really confused and didn't even know what I was ordering- like they had not even looked at the menu at all. I will definitely go back but will stick to my iced coffee and farm egg sandwich in the future.","review","rWAz-KTylKA6cfD9lEHPqQ",0,0,0,"Urban Beans","Coffee & Tea,Food,Bars,Nightlife,Restaurants,Sandwiches",0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,2

 Das Publikum ist abwechslungsreich, vom HFG-Stundenten (Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung) √ºber Medientechnikinteressierte Touristen bis zum Architektentreffen und Familienausfl√ºgler. 
Man kann beobachten, auch in der Halle Kunstobjekte bestaunen (derzeit sehr sch√∂n: die Lichtinstallation ""Space Invaders"" von Rainer Kehres und Sebastian Hungerer)

   This location is near my place of employment as well as my wife's so we stop here with great regularity. As is the case with most Starbuck's, the staff is very friendly and quite cognoscente of customer wait times. This is a tall order considering the extra customer load that was heaped upon this store when the shop at Charleston and Torrey Pines was closed. Even with the expanded workload the service is always great. I occasionally go inside to make my purchase, but I find that the drive thru is a better option when I'm in a hurry. 
  One suggestion I will make on the beverage front is the Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate. It's a seasonal thing that comes out during the holidays. If you haven't tried it, you really should.

The location for this place is perfecto. It's located next to Sushi Koma, which I hears has some pretty good sushi, so you can pre-game or post-op with some caffeinated delights. There is also a hookah bar nearby, but I don't know if you can bring coffee in there, even though that would be an awesome idea!

As for Darak itself, walking in, you feel like your inside a living room. What can be better than that? It's probably the most comfortable coffee shop I have ever been to in my life.

I'm a coffee drinker, and the prices here are extremely reasonable. They are well made using quality beans and correct techniques. I like the fact they aren't afraid to brew slightly more on the stronger side. I always get an Americano, and enjoy the rich, dark roasted taste! I've had lattes and cappuccinos here as well, and they are quite good. I haven't had any of their teas (teaze) here, but from what I've heard, they are very good.

Service is always impeccable! The employees are always polite and friendly, and also extremely diligent in their responsibilities and work duties.

I could not rate this any less than 5 stars because it was as close to as faultless as possible. I could take a star away because I thought their cakes weren't so hot, but, I haven't tried any since their opening, and it seems like they changed up their desserts so I'm not going to pick on that. Great place and I'm a regular!

I rolled up at the allotted time, 8:30, and there was plenty of room to sit (well, proportionately to the amount of seating in general, which isn't a whole bundle because, I repeat, DINKY). And the seat was one of those super-fun stools that has legs but also swivels - a spinning top part that allows you to go ""wheeeeeeee"" if you so desire (and I do so desire).

As you know by now, I'm not a coffee person, so I asked rather bashfully for a tea and received No Judgement. This is good. I have fear of asking for tea in a coffee shop. It seems almost as gauche as asking for coffee in a teashop (almost, but not quite). Anyway, judgement was not forthcoming.

I also requested an almond croissant. It was fairly big. I began my bold ascent armed with nothing but a knife; some days later, short of breath in the thin air, I reached the summit. Wearily, I sat down at last on the mirror-like slope of a crisped almond flake, looking down at the city, spread out below me like a town in miniature.

I've literally been coming here since it opened, I was there for the first year anniversary and literally countless days in between, yet I haven't given a Yelp review yet - weird!

If Yelp had half stars, I'd give Giant 4.5, but all the slight nuances add up, and I don't feel right giving 5.

The coffee bean:
I'll start by saying Four Barrel is a great choice; I've always loved it, and probably always will - 4B is one of my favorite coffee shops in the world.  That said, I'd prefer something local was used.  The coffee has to be shipped here weekly, from San Francisco, which in turn makes for a mixed experience.  If you want beans, you have to deal with the dates they have available, which by the time it gets processed in SF, shipped, repackaged (at Giant) and put on the shelf, is at least a week old at this point.

The shop:
The shop itself is great.  I've been absolutely in love with the giant front windows that open up to let in the fresh air (when it's not a zillion degrees outside).  I love the lighting, mix of modern steel structure and vintage furniture.  Attached to Bunky, who, while on the expensive side, has some cool stuff.  The baristas are generally pretty great, with a choice few being extremely great.  Credit/debit purchases require $5+, which is slightly annoying if all you want is a small drink; I generally bring cash.  There's roughly 4 parking spots out front, countless parking across the street at CVS (literally a 15 second walk from here) and about 12-15 spots in the back - you enter either from the alley just east of 1st street [if you're by the library], or go between the gas station and the Thai restaurant [if you're entering from McDowell]).

Drinks:
The drink menu is great.  You can get timeless classics, or new-old twists.  This is one of two shops in the whole PHX area that does a pour-over right.  Espresso is pulled short and flavor-abound.  The drip flows constantly, and generally is re-made after it's sat too long.  I'm a straight up coffee person, so I stick to pour-over, drip or espresso, but the mocha is a delightful drink, with a good quality chocolate, home-made whipped creme and chocolate shavings on top.  Giant serves Straus dairy with their drinks, which is a plus in my book.  The beans rotate with Four Barrel's bean menu.  Like the other venues Matt Pool runs, expect no substitutions or special orders here (which shouldn't be a shock if you ever frequence Matt's Big Breakfast or Roosevelt).  I understand not serving a traditional machiatto or espresso to go, but there are some ""rules"" that could be stretched here to accommodate for the customer.

Fare:
I've mixed opinions of the fare at Giant.  It's nothing to do with taste and creativity - those are generally spot on.  Different things are generally whipped up, so you never get bored with the selection.  That said, in the past (and I think this baker is no longer working here), I've seen quick-bread that wasn't cooked throughout, which is one of the most disgusting things to stumble upon while eating something tasty.  Again, I've not experienced this or anything negative lately.

All in all:
Great shop, great tastes, friendly baristas.  A couple annoyances, but overall a good go-to.","review","hVkQbDk61hmIi5iVm3IkZw",0,0,3,"Giant Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",6,14,2,13,14,2,8,16,10,31

Now I realize that 'Indie' Coffee refers to independent film, as there are film reels and cameras on the walls and counters. So yeah, neither here nor there but...anyway.

The sizes for their brewed coffee are named after the local Madison lakes, and I got the largest size, which I believe was the Monona. I thought it was very reasonable at $2.25. There was a house brew, an Ethiopian brew and a decaf ready to go, I chose the Ethiopian. It was their lightest roast and it was delicious, if a little less strongly brewed than I would prefer it. The temperature was pretty hot but not unreasonably so, and it tasted very freshly made.

My son had a large iced caramel latte and he didn't remark about it one way or the other, but had it gone in a flash. 

We've gone there before to work on our laptops and have discussions, and it's quiet and intimate enough for both. I kind of like their thick, butcher-block style tables and the little lamps on them, which makes it feel cozy and homey.

Last time we had food too, bagel sandwiches, and they were great. Mine had spinach and roasted red peppers, always a great combo.

After we checked in and unpacked, we were jonesin' for some grub and this was the first restaurant we saw in the lobby.

But the location being situated smack dab in the middle of a noisy, heavily trafficked lobby, and the quality of food did little to convince me. 

I had the seared tuna salad. The tuna was absolutely overcooked and the potatoes were very large and seemed shoved into the salad along with the unruly green beans. The glass of Riesling was ok. Granted, the service was adequate and they do make an effort to capture the look of a Parisian cafe (blue painted skies and random Parisian decor) but the hectic atmosphere overshadows all.

Yeah i'd seriously wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. We only went here due to it being a Sunday and all the major hot spots were closed (Stephano's, 28Go, that taco place). 

Service was alright considering there's only one person on staff to man both the drinks and front counter and the kitchen in the back. That could account of the quality of the food but if they knew there was only going to be one person then the food could have been prepared and if it was could also account for it's quality.

Fusion Fries
 - seriously almost 7 dollars for frozen fries with sauce, mayo, and rice topping sprinkles. SEVEN DOLLARS!! at most it's worth 3.95! portion size wasnt even that big!

Pork Belly on rice (daily special)
 - Wow seriously the blandest pork belly i've ever had. Waste of what could have been bacon. Not sure if it's suppose to taste like nothing but it tasted like....nothing. Even the chunks of pork belly which has the fat had any flavor to it.

Curry Rice w/Chicken Katsu
 - The chicken was pretty decent. Dark meat and had a nice crunchy crust and they even seasoned the chicken with a little salt. The rest of it was meh. Potato salad was halfway cooked containing bits of still raw potato hunks. Curry was Golden brand brick instant curry and is there a shortage of the stuff? When that nuclear reactor blew up did it take out the curry brick factory? When you think of Katsu Curry you're expecting a bowl with just all curry sauce, in island of rice, and a few strips of fried chicken slightly submerged in the curry. Nope exact opposite here. Mountains of rice with just a light mist of curry.

Expensive too. WAY expensive. When your target market are college students your strategy should be cheap and plentiful so they keep coming back. 3pm Cafe is neither cheap nor is it very plentiful.","review","A3mpjzazkSDkua4cPSayYA",0,0,3,"3pm Cafe","Food,Coffee & Tea,Cafes,Japanese,Restaurants",2,6,2,5,4,3,0,6,6,16

Don't be fooled by its location in an apartment building--this coffee is excellent. My advice is to be a real stickler and be VERY picky about what coffee you get--they only serve Kickapoo, which is the best roaster in the entire region (suck it, Intelligentsia!). 

See what they have brewing, and get the SINGLE ORIGIN coffees--not the blends. 

It's very good. No, it's no Bradburys (and they don't even do pourovers!), but considering the quality of the coffee and proximity to the law school? It's definitely the best near campus.

I wonder what other gems are on there.  I was a little nervous they did not have it but then I saw the lady behind the counter washing sweet potatoes and realized I must be in the right place.

The decor, layout, the people there...really hipster for Arizona. I had the chicken tortilla soup (wasn't impressed) and some squash and risotto (that had no risotto in it because it apparently was reduced down to nothing) so it was basically just squash. Trust me, I asked. 

When you line up to order, someone takes your drink order first and starts making your drink.....and then you order your food separately. That sounds great...because it seems like it's more efficient, but then when we paid, we realized that the person that took our drink order didn't communicate that with the person that rung us up, we ended up not paying for the drinks, so we didn't get any drinks, and we only got our food. Hmmm...maybe efficiency doesn't always equal accuracy.

The store is beautiful. It's in a pretty ritzy little PV/Scottsdale shopping center, so one would expect that. 

I had fun talking to the sassy girl behind the counter - we quipped back and forth, and she questioned me about the photos I was taking with my cell phone suspicious about where they would end up. I sent one to my girlfriend (she has the word ""CUPCAKE"" tattooed on the inside of her bottom lip) to which she replied: ""YOU""RE KILLING ME!"" It may or may not have had a part in her decision to go to Bikram yoga tonight. 

I asked why they weren't at the Cupcake Love-in, and she said it was because they were busy... now that I've tasted the cupcakes, I'd guess it was probably because they didn't want to embarrass all the other bakeries. I mean, wow. All three were beautifully crafted, and in the display case they all looked very uniform - like it didn't matter which Salted Caramel one you got, they would all be the same.

I had Banana Nutella - holy crap, so amazing. The flavors were distinct, but not overpowering. It wasn't overly sweet either. The cake was moist and fluffy (but substantial), and the frosting was creamy and soft. There was no sour or sugary aftertaste.

I also had their Double Chocolate... It was very moist and very chocolate forward. It was a bold flavor. Again, it wasn't overly sweet and the consistency of the cake and frosting was the same. If you're a chocolate lover, this is serious business.

Finally got my girlfriend's favorite - Red Velvet. I'm normally not a huge fan because the frosting on these often tastes ""off"" to me. This is hands-down the best Red Velvet I've ever tasted. The frosting was again not too sweet and the flavor only hinted just enough at cream-cheese. The cake was delicious as well. Again, no aftertaste - and after sampling all 3, I didn't feel sick to my stomach with sugar overload. 

The pretzel sticks dipped in various sweets were amazing.

They have a good range of predesigned sandwich fillings if you're not feeling creative, but they're also really patient if you want to make your own...even if you do keep changing your mind every two seconds like I usually do.

There's the usual choice of white/brown/seedy/crunchy/soft breads to choose from as you'd expect, but the best thing is that when it's full you'll struggle to spend more than ¬£3 on your work of sandwich art.

Speaking of the fillings, they order them all in fresh every day so you know you'll never get any nasty surprises - no fizzy humus or brown lettuce like you get in other lunchtime sandwich places.

But the fact that they order it all in that same day does mean that if you go later on at lunchtime they are likely to have run out of the more popular ingredients. Also, they're only open until 3pm-ish so if you get the mid-afternoon munchies then Picnic Basket will not be there to save the day. Instead, you'll probably end up nipping across the street to Scotmid, spending the same ¬£3 on a pre-packed sandwich, and realising all over again just how great Picnic Basket really is.","review","OTQ68fm6EtcPD2n0g6Y2mQ",0,0,0,"Picnic Basket","Food,Coffee & Tea,Fast Food,Restaurants",3,10,2,3,9,4,7,11,3,15

I have met Jennifer too, their District Manager.  I have watched many crowds of people come and go, many of them students at UNLV.  

They have always been courteous, friendly, and encouraging, and do their best to make everyone feel at home here.  In fact, they know my drink and often make it when the see me walking in the door.  By the time I pay for it it is ready.

They were the first in the area to offer free Wifi, back when Starbucks was still charging for it.  A couple of years ago, they installed a system that ensured only customers could use it.  If you purchase something, they will give you a login slip which is good for six hours.  This was necessary, due to the lage number of freeloaders who came simply to use the wifi, and did not purchase anything.  I have even seen people sitting in their car using it.  

This was a great idea, and not unreasonable.  I myself got clear wire, so I didn't have to rely on their wifi, or anyone else's.  But I recently purchased an iPad, which requires a wifi hot spot.  No problem now.  There is free wifi everywhere.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that the Wifi here is not very good since they installed their security system.  I can not watch a you tube video.  The system drops my connection every five minutes or so, and I have to reconnect.  I have talked to other long time customers who have assured me of the same thing.  The wifi connection sucks.  

I bought this iPad so I can check Facebook, check my mail, and do other menial tasks that I do on a daily basis.  It works like a champ, and I don't have to worry - there is free wifi anywhere.  It is a shame that I now come here to get my morning Latte', and then go over to Starbucks to continue my morning and use the Internet for a little while.  

I know there were people downloading all kinds of stuff and hogging all the bandwidth a few years ago.  But the world has changed!  The system they installed is no longer necessary, especially if I can't watch a streaming video or use Pandora to listen to music on my headphones while working.  So, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!

A friend offered to take me on a scenic drive and along the way, I decided that I needed a coffee. Sadly, Yelp was no help at finding a Starbucks (You're probably saying that I also don't know much about good coffee...) only because there wasn't one for 20 miles. (Yeah, probably the only place in the world you can get away from Starbucks!). But when I searched on just ""Coffee"" this place popped onto the radar. So we headed here.

I was seriously impressed. The prices were pretty solid, the service was really good and the coffee... well, the coffee was simply excellent. I chose to go with an iced hazelnut coffee and it was great tasting coffee, blended perfectly with just the right amount of syrup to give it that hint of hazelnuts.

It's a good thing for my wallet that I live 2000+ miles away from Mountain Brew because I'd be spending most of my time and money right here!

I figured since I was in Mesa I would meet with some of my readers to sign some books. I couldn't find the coffee house I initially intended to sign at, even with a Mapquest map. Instead I came across this establishment. 

Being an author, I spend quite a bit of time in quite a few coffee shops around the valley. My default brew at any new new place I try is the Americano bold roast.

Without exaggeration, Bold Roost is one of the more obnoxious coffee houses I've ever been to (including Starbucks, which I detest). First, the Americano was luke warm, overly bitter (even with 3 sugars and cream), and tasted as if it was made with tap water. Second, the service was absent, the two young women were more interested in talking to each other than following up. Lastly and most importantly (to me), the MUSIC was obnoxiously loud and poorly selected. When I arrived I was greeted with club music - pounding bass with screaming or chanting. Since I needed to stay a while I ended up listening to reggae. I can appreciate almost any genre of music for an hour or two. But the bass and chanting and the consistently loud, inescapable volume of the ""music"" was too obnoxious to allow me to concentrate on writing. If I wasn't meeting people I would have left after ten minutes.

I'm sticking it out until my readers get here. After that I hope never to see this place again. Not recommended.","review","MKZh-O5OLJcR1exReXhJHQ",1,2,2,"Bold Roost Espresso Bar and Cafe","Food,Sandwiches,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",4,6,6,2,7,9,3,2,7,13

However, the espresso in my caff√® macchiato (called an espresso macchiato on the menu) was awful - very sour and medicinal tasting. I'm not sure if it was a specific roast or if it was because we went late at night (nearly 9pm) but it was simply not good. I'd have to try it mixed in a drink but nearly plain, it was undrinkable.

Being the indecisive little thing that I am, I had no clue where to go or what I wanted to eat.... but thanks to yelp! I decided to check out this place. (Thanks yelpers!)

The Coffee Shop is cute -- there are lots of windows filling the place with natural light and it also gave the place a more spacious feeling. It wasn't too crowded when I went there but there were enough people where you could feel comfortable and not have to worry about feeling suffocated, or even worse, being watched by employees (paranoid, much?)

I ordered the tomato basil sandwich, which also came with mozzarella, onion, avocado, and feta cheese. The tomatoes that were in my sandwich were one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Other than that the sandwich was kind of salty (because of the feta cheese I think?) but the amount of tomatoes they added helped balance the overall flavor.

I also got to try the pesto chicken sandwich, which I thought was even better than the sandwich that I ordered. The pesto was SO GOOD!  I would (and will) order that sandwich next time I am here. 

The best part about the sandwiches is that they tasted so fresh that it almost made me think it could offset the load of processed crap I consumed this past week (damn you, guilt).

I didn't try any of their drinks or cupcakes (see: binge) but I do plan on coming back to try them out because they looked really good. They had an interesting selection of cupcakes with plump frosting tops that came in cute names like ""lemon glam"" and ""sweetheart cherry"". Some of their cupcake selections were vegan too!

Knowing there was a Starbucks nearby but wanting something a bit more novel I pulled up the Yelp locator and noted a familiar name from my research on the city; Cartel Coffee Lab, apparently a new location filling the space of a now defunct store that used to serve their beans.  Having heard good things about their sourcing, roasting, and brewing I made my way into the small store to find a number of folks lounging, surfing the web, and enjoying their coffee and on making my way to the counter I was met by not only a prompt and friendly barista, but also a knowledgeable one who asked what I liked in a coffee (full, thick, cocoa, low acid for those curious) and he spot-on recommended the Ethiopian Dark Roast at $3/8oz or $16.99/lb.

Taking his suggestion while discussing the other six varieties available I was quoted prices, terroir, and tasting notes as he prepared my single drip and with options ranging from $12.99 for 12oz to $29.99 for 12oz I was told that all were available by the cup if I wanted to taste - a mental note well engrained for my next trip to the area.  With coffee prepared and limited options for sweetener (muscovado sugar or Agave nectar only) I opted to drink it black and sipping the brew the flavor was spot on to what I appreciate - velvety, cocoa tinged, and a bit of cherry and almond.  An important aspect of any city I'm considering as my next home it is good to know that Phoenix/Scottsdale has a place like this - very important.","review","5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA",4,4,3,"Cartel Coffee Lab","Food,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",3,8,0,1,4,5,5,9,11,18

So this morning I really wanted a coffee.. But having just pennies in the bank account I thought that I'd reallllllly reallllllllly realllllly have to want one, to sacrifice the 2.10 in my pocket. So, with a bit of hesitation, I walk into piecebox with the intention of a coffee to go. 

After waiting about a minute or so for the lady infront of me to be served, the lady at the till asks what I would like. Definitely not in any sort of enthusiastic manner, which is to be expected really, but she also did not give any sort of eye contact. 
After, "" One large Cappuccino please.""

She starts to make my drink. First, there was a random coffee cup that was on the machine, she pours what is left at the bottom of this, and then quickly heats up some milk that was in the metal jug, and pours. Voila! Really fast, almost too fast.. and what was that coffee cup fillup? a shot already made? Didn't look big. Well no, it wasn't, it couldn't be.

She gave a wee sprinkle of chocolate on top, and away I go, with a giant take-away coffee cup (one of those bigger sizes, like starbucks style). Now at this point I thought, this was fast, but I was curious as to what my coffee would taste like. 

So I start walking down the street to find what basically tastes like a giant cup of hot milk, with a bit of taste of chocolate on top. Pretty much the worst cappuccino I've ever had in my life. With a hope of finding something that would taste remotely like coffee, I decided to pour quite a fair amount of drink down the drain on the street. 

Nope, no coffee. :( ... my poor 2.10 down the drain (literally) and then into the bin. I was so sad. 

Next time piecebox, actually make some shots of espresso please, fast service is only okay when it's quality! People don't like giant cups of hot milk!","review","OskgfrWPNYEQVLMOrNjF6A",2,4,4,"Piecebox","Food,Bakeries,Coffee & Tea",3,11,0,5,4,2,3,9,3,8

Out of all the five local coffee joints I stopped by during a trip to Phoenix, this one I'd have to say was the best of them.  I drove past them while pursuing breakfast, but decided to stop by on my way back down 7th, to have a cup of coffee and figure out what to do with the rest of my day.

There isn't a ton of parking, but there is plenty of places to park on the street.  It's a small, cozy, repurposed gas station as everyone else has pointed out, and the interior is simple, yet relaxing feeling.  Parents with their kids sit outside of this kind of place.  Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open, so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.

The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft, and it was practically right out of a commercial, with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter, and was probably the best I had on my trip.

And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area, and if they had any suggestions of anything to do, whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.

The experience as a whole was easily worth five stars.  Convenient location, free parking, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and quality products.

While the shop itself is a rather small store it is always packed with young and old alike. Who doesn't like a little sugar rush after visiting one of the local restaurants?

What comes to mind when I step into Churn is did I really just reach ""88 miles per hour""? This store totally takes me back in time.  I know there are a plethora of 1950's style diners but this old school candy and ice cream store reminds me of going to the local drug store and buying a sundae for a quarter as a kid in the tiny town of Haysprings Nebraska, where you could buy a bag of candy for a nickel from the local pharmacist.  

While as a kid in a small town your choices were usually limited to vanilla and whatever berry was in season, Churn offers a wide variety of traditional and contemporary flavors like vanilla or peanut butter.  I would love to see a bacon flavor one day:)  when one of my party ordered a rocky road they made it fresh with giant pieces of nuts and a toasted marshmallow on top. It was amazing. 

Not only does this place have awesome ice cream but it is also a candy store. I found so many candies that I loved as a child that are quite difficult to find anymore. Some of the candies are fun playful items like wax mustaches and candy ninjas while others are more traditional gummy bears and jelly beans.

All I could think was ""This must be what coffee shops in re-education camps look like"". (It's not *that* bad- and they have more traditional seating in the back; I think this is just how they've had to adjust to crowding.) Because of that, it took me a few minutes after taking myself to really feel comfortable. 

I had a tasty (and cheap, albeit small) pot of tea and sat down facing the opposite direction, just to be contrarian. Their wifi was free, which is a big plus, but they didn't have good power outlet access, which is a big minus. The staff was friendly, the selection of teas was phenomenal, but the music was just a bit too loud (and at some times, flat out awkward) for my tastes, and all in all, it just didn't quite click.

"lWWKIdzgYNddKRYxbkO7SA","2014-05-12","qfp6Y1TXhDREvAfQ91MB8w",4,"Uptown Waterloo has a fair number of quaint and exquisite coffeehouses, many of which do not advertise their stores; they simply believe in their services, food, and loyal customers' word of mouth. So here I write, as a new loyal customer.

TLDR: Exquisite, yet bold and complicated. The ambiance of the cafe sparked my desire to revisit with a book, a pen and a notebook. With a cup of loose leaf tea (and maybe dessert), it's the right place to relax, chat and get inspired.

The moment I stepped into the cafe, I was mesmerized by its interior. The coffeehouse reminded me of a rustic yet modern British cafe in the movies. The old brick walls had lost some of its original colour but maintained its picturesque look. I can tell the owner wanted to construct an atmosphere that was casual enough for everyday conversations without losing the potential to become a semi-formal place for business. And that was exactly what the coffeehouse is: a blend of sophisticated students and professionals.

DVLB is different than your ordinary coffeehouses. Why? Well, it serves whisky. Single-malt whisky, ""the true pinnacle of all whisky goodness.""

Didn't expect that, did ya?

To top it off, DVLB offers a whisky map for your tasting journey. For those interested, they carry a wide selection from light to rich, delicate to smoky, from around Scotland, Japan, Canada, Australia, India and more. Sadly, I've yet to become a whisky drinker, but if you've ventured and tried their whiskies, let me know how they turned out!

One random and weird rule I follow when trying new cafes is only order the coffee when the tea is not just tea. That is, the tea brings deep thoughts into your consciousness, or a blissful smile on your face.

Chai tea is like the standard for reviewing a coffeehouse. It's the most basic spiced tea that every cafe carries. My eyes widened when I first took a sip of the tea; it wasn't sweet at all! Instead, the foamy milk brought out the fragrance of the spices without the sweetness getting in the way. As a frequent customer of chain cafes like Williams, Second Cup and Starbucks, the fact that the tea was unsweetened certainly left quite an impression. Of course, DVLB provides you with sugars and other additions, but they weren't necessary.

The tea reminded me of the Doctor. ""Good cup of tea! Super-heated infusion of free-radicals and tannin, just the thing for healing the synapses..."" Very British.

I recently completed a two week stint at the Edinburgh Festival. After every single performance at 1pm i would head down to Pie Maker for cheap, satisfying and tasty lunch time sustenance. It is brilliant! An actors dream. Pies are handheld, very filling and can range from 85p to about ¬£2. My lunch in London comes to about ¬£5 daily for similar qualities!

The range of pies they do to is fantastic. Everything from your classics such as steak and ale, cottage to Balti pies, as well as more sweet pastries. All are made fresh in store as well and very nutritious. The Haggis Pie was quite the stand out for me.

Not only that, Pie Maker do great deals - for instance 'Spend over ¬£2 and get a free donut'!

The staff are brilliant and remember you from day to day (something you could never expect in London)

THE PASTRY IS BLOODY INCREDIBLE!

Pie Maker was a staple part of my Edinburgh Festival and helped make up one of the best experiences of my life.

I'm a fan of the snickerlicious or just the traditional mocha iced or hot, though lately I've got onboard the iced coffee train. everything I've had has been good quality, another interesting touch is coffee ice, if you order an iced drink they actually use frozen coffee cubes as the ice, so even when the ice melts it doesn't spoil your drink.

they have a drive through and they're usually pretty quick,one of my friends that used to loaf around mesa with me always insists on going here when he's on my side of town. prices are reasonable, and they don't feel the need to blend italian and french nonsensical words as drink names just for the heck of it.

Packing us in like travelin' sardines of the sky, the average airport experience is bound to be colorless, uncomfortable and a pain in the wallet. As a whole, options in Phoenix perfectly match this description for me. Being here is like sitting through a Chuck Norris movie.

Cartel Coffee, by shocking contrast, is like a special guest appearance by Bill Murray: completely unexpected, instantly memorable, and almost familial, this coffee shop has all of the basic ingredients that make this small local chain invariably cool. The barista was, like, my neighbor, with a t-shirt that said something along the lines of ""I Like Cows"". Likewise with the other guy. And the music was really good. And they had cold brewed, my favorite. And so I got my cup and turned around and set myself down on a chair and if only for a moment, just one blink in time and space, I imagined myself upon a little urban cloud of delight.

The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast.

The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.

My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijing's yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didn't get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty.

I had read some yelp reviews before we went but sometimes you cant trust other yelpers. When people have a good experience they might tell a friend or two but when they have a bad one they want to let the entire planet know.

Took Mom for her first taste of Gelato Spot's frozen delights.  Despite my informing her that she could sample as much as she'd like, which cute Stephen echoed back from behind the counter, she refused to try any more after five (mango, raspberry, coffee, pistachio, chocolate-fudge-brownie).  Owner (sorry, he didn't give me his name) also came out to help me w/ samples, and I decided I was going to have a $6 banana split.  ""How many scoops of gelato do I get,"" I asked him, and he sheepishly said, ""Oh, I don't know... I'm only the owner, ha ha, but let me find out!""  So cute!  :)  As I paced back and forth, surveying the menu boards and the flavor cases for my selections, owner said ""You're going to love whatever you decide upon, I can tell!""  Well, you can imagine my disappointment then when Stephen later informed me that the store was out of bananas!  I even said I'd be willing to wait until someone comes back w/ a supply of bananas, but this, I was told, was not going to happen, and THAT is the reason I couldn't make this a four-star review.  

Had I been able to order the banana split, I would've also tried a nice cuppa Giuseppe, but I settled on getting the three gelato flavors we wanted two-ways: in a $5 gelato sundae (two scoops, mango and regular chocolate-- Mom thought the fudge variety was too sweet to get a whole scoop of) and a $5 brownie sundae (single scoop of coffee).  Stephen was nice enough to check for corn syrup-free labels and found a couple I could try-- the hard-shell chocolate and the caramel.  Gelato Spot's mango sorbet is my new fave (what, I favor a sorbet over cream-based gelato??) and was our pick out of what we had this afternoon, w/ the regular chocolate being the wrong choice over the chocolate-fudge-brownie.  

Thanks to the nice stranger who gave me his untouched chocolate-banana shake leftovers to sample.  No thanks to the same stranger for using up all of the bananas! :(  LOL

Gelato Spot is upgrading!  For the last couple of months, they've added more seating, focused on offering more toppings to add on the gelatos (bad idea, I think... yes, this coming from someone who just tried to order a banana split from a gelato shop!; toppings bar will be up and running in two or three weeks, I'm told), and pizzas!  Yes, you read correctly-- G-Spot started serving pizzas two weeks ago!  Text ITALY to 30364 for $3 off pizzas, and COFFEE for $1 off coffees.

Try the mango, or a chocolate-banana shake (so delicious!!), and be sure to say yes to roasted almonds when they ask if you want nuts on your sundae- so good!  :)

I love ice cream, so I went for a cup of cookies and creme. From the first bite, it was orgasmic bliss, deliciously smooth and creamy, cooling, and not terribly sweet - just enough. It's pricey dessert goodness, but worth it for those with sweet tooths.

 Es ist sch√∂n hell (Schaufenster...), die Leute hinter der Theke interessieren sich f√ºr ihre Produkte, die angebotenen Backwaren (Muffins, Croissants, Butterbrezel, Wraps etc.) sind frisch und gut.

I'll be honest - its main draw for me is its convenience. It is literally right across the street from my flat, which makes it quite convenient if I want to meet a friend for tea or just duck out for some quiet study time. Would I travel a long way to come here? No way, not with all the other great coffee shops in Edinburgh. But Beanscene does have some strong selling points:
1) The atmosphere is charming. Leather sofas, comfy chairs, an antique feel...It really is quite homey. The downside of this coziness, however, is that the place is quite small and can feel a bit TOO cozy when you're literally touching knees with the person next to you. 
2) Great drinks. I love their teas and coffees! I think my favorite part of them is actually the cups and mugs they're served in. The whole place feels quite high-quality, rather than a franchised chain shop. 
3) It's not just about coffee. While I have not yet had the food here, people seem to really enjoy it - especially the pizza! That's great, because it's not often that a place will be great for a coffee date AND lunch.

For high quality oolong, I've seen better prices elsewhere so I'll probably stick to their tea blends moving forward.  Otherwise, I felt most of their pricing was very reasonable.

The level of customer service was exemplary.  The lady who helped me was more than happy to take the vague direction of flavor I was looking for and make suggestions on what to try.  I threw her a request for ""dessert"" flavors and one of the recommendations she gave - Lemon Souffl√© - was one I didn't expect to like but turned out to be my favorite of the purchases that day.

The boyfriend and I are loyal fans of the Farmhouse which is right next door. But we'd been curious about their neighbor for a while so we finally decided to check out Liberty Market. It was a Sunday and I think there was a show at the Hale Theatre because the place was packed. We stood in line for quite a while. 

I ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs, biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. We also ordered a slice of chocolate chip banana bread and a slice of red velvet cake to go because that's just how we roll.

I thought the banana bread was pretty good, boyfriend thought it was too dry. My demi-breakfast was okay but my biscuit was too powdery, like they didn't mix the dough well enough. There was actually a clump of flour in part of it. Considering how amazing the biscuits are at the Farmhouse next door I was disappointed. Boyfriend was not impressed with the quesadilla either.

Later that afternoon we decided to try out the red velvet cake. Like the breakfast, it was just okay. Nothing I would crave or make the trip across town for.

Overall, I like Joe's other places (Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill) much better. Although I will say the staff was very nice and I liked the atmosphere. Maybe their lunch is good?

The coffee is above average, as have been most of the specialty drinks I've tried. Their extra-caffeinated ""Totti coffee"" can be helpful for an extra jolt of energy, especially to the highly caffeine-tolerant.

I stopped by one early morning to redeem a Groupon good for 2 dozen donuts.  I was the only customer and the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and helpful.  He asked if I wanted an assortment and I told him yes, I'd like to try everything.  He verified that I wouldn't have a problem with some of the flavors and I confirmed that I wanted it all (including the coconut and maple bacon).  He told me it would be about ten minutes until they were ready and I had no problem waiting.  My actual wait was more like 5 minutes or less.  Again, the gentleman was very nice.  I thanked him for my selection of little donuts and was on my way.  

I have to admit that they are very pretty donuts.  Some of the donuts have distinct flavors but after two all I could taste was myself getting diabetes from all the sugar.  So that would be my main complaint.  They seem to all just be plain little donuts with different flavored icings and toppings.  The end result with each just ends up being way too much sugar.  

My other concern is that even with my Groupon this still felt like an expensive venture.  I'm glad I tried them and was able to experience various levels of blood sugar but I shan't be returning.","review","9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg",1,0,7,"Peace, Love and Little Donuts","Food,Donuts,Coffee & Tea",2,7,1,3,5,3,2,8,5,16

It has Nutella, banana and strawberry. I was sooooooo high from the sugar afterward. I can't eat this everyday but its definitely a treat. 
In case you don't know what's so special about their waffles, well I can explain. 
Their speciality is the Belgian Liege Waffle.. The dough is thicker than regular waffles mix and it has Belgian Pearl Sugar. They smashed a pre-measured dough into a waffle iron and it create this wonderful caramelized crisp shell and soft sugary inside. Soooo good. You MUST try at least ONCE in this lifetime. 
Those waffles were so good but I wasn't too crazy about their lattes. Definitely not their speciality. Maybe next time, I'll just get a regular cup coffee...","review","brErQvsmemP1CaLMt33gnw",0,0,4,"Cast Iron Waffles","Food,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",7,5,1,5,7,7,7,11,13,14

I tried out the birthday cake with some brownie.  Delicious.  The texture was very smooth.  Unlike some ice cream shops, the dessert didn't lose its flavor halfway through (I'm still baffled how that can happen).

The cool way of blending ice cream and mix-ins, which gives the treat its awesome texture, is also its downfall.  I expect a certain texture when getting brownies added to my ice cream.  Unfortunately, all of the brownie gets blended into smithereens, leaving you the taste, but not the chewy pieces.

I'm just lost as to why I paid so much for a drink that's not all that. 

Ok, I liked the fresh fruit...the strawberries and blueberries and all were fresh. I liked how they sealed the cup up too which was kinda interesting. And I liked how long my drink lasted as I left and got all the way to I-215 & I-515 before it was gone. But yet the drink was just ho hum. It didn't really wow me. Maybe it was my conservative first time choice of ingredients that caused me to not be going OMG this is awesome as I type this and see Nelson Q. and Rockne H.'s reviews with 4 and 5 stars staring at me as proof that I obviously must have missed something here.

Literally everything about my experience was wrong when I was visiting Madison some weeks back.  I had heard from my close friend who lives there that it was this amazing creperie that made one heck of a cup of Joe, and all I got out of it was delayed, soggy, hipster pretentiousness. 

First and foremost, for the ""popularity"" of this little restaurant, it is tiny.  When we arrived, it was quite crowded inside, and shortly after there was a line out the door.  There's practically no place to put up your coat in the cold weather, and if you want to try and eat there - good luck!  Seating is definitely not ample and the crowd all trying to sit down and talk at once makes for a bit of an angry mob.

As for the food - my friend and I ordered two crepes - one savory with gouda, apple, buckwheat, and ham, and the other with apples and pecans.  Both were simply ""eh"" to say the least.  Part of the savory crepe was crisp the way it should be, and another portion was soggy and mushy.  The inside was struggling for flavor beyond the overpowering whole grain mustard (which I do enjoy), but the gouda flavor was basically undetectable and I was also searching for sliced apples.  The most annoying part to me perhaps was that the filling had thinly sliced ham instead of chunks which led to even more sadness about the whole experience.  In order to really get the flavor of meat in a crepe, you've got to do better than deli sliced blandness.

Honestly worst of all, the service was unorganized and a confused mess.  After entering and placing our order right away, it took roughly 25 minutes to get our crepes to us because our order was forgotten.  Other people who came in after received their orders before us which made me raise my voice to ask what was going on.  What was going on, you ask?  They had crossed off our ticket despite never even making our meal.

What an utterly disappointing disaster.  I hope to forget you soon, Bradbury's.","review","whbN3rBg5zmpksbU3WhwTA",0,0,1,"Bradbury's","Food,Coffee & Tea,Creperies,Restaurants",5,5,3,4,7,5,4,8,15,13

When it comes to coffee places, you know what you will get at a place like Starbucks or Crazy Mocha, but finding a local spot just adds to the overall experience that the previous two cannot provide. As far as local Pittsburgh coffee spots go, so far this is at the middle if the pack but worth visiting in downtown. Especially since it is in market square. I am a sucker for history and want to try Nicholas's again. There is a large selection of coffee, for boutique type prices for some. The daily coffee my second time was much better but still if you have been in existence since 1919 I would expect a great product, or one that is different from all the rest due to your almost 100 years. 

The 5 senses review:

Sight: 8-the main saving grace. It is really cool, quaint, and charming. This is where the history helps. 

Smell: 6-just like other coffee places it is always nice to walk in and get nailed with the aroma of the brewed and ground beans. 

Taste: 6- UPDATED! Much better coffee of the day. So lesson learned. Get a ""coffee of the day"" at your own risk. 

Sound: 3-remember a low number is good. Nice and relaxed with the just the sounds of a working coffee shop. No over powering shitty music, thankfully!

Touch: 2-only because you aren't really using your hands for anything. I did get a biscotti there which was very good. So since I used my hands I need to add some rating.","review","dynQt0Dirs4DhLKXpsQSyg",0,0,0,"Nicholas Coffee Co","Food,Coffee & Tea",5,7,1,4,4,4,4,7,6,16

I can say that Delica Bistro does have a European feel to it, especially the pastries. I had a delicious croissant made with orange, sesame and Thyme that was just delicious and the sampler shortbread cookie I tried, wonderful! As for the coffee beverages, I had a double espresso for $2.50 (quite reasonable), made with Lilly coffee, which seems to be the Euro brand of coffee. My neighbors, also along for a local bike jaunt, had crepes, that were just lovely! I strongly recommend you check this place out and due to its location by the area off Mill near the AMC Centerpoint theaters, feels like you are on a piazza. 

Be advised they just opened and are still working out some operational bugs. My friends crepes took a bit of time but someone came over and apologized so they know they need to work some things out (they also came by a short time later with the option to sample a shortbread cookie so de nada). I did get my espresso in a small paper cup and hopefully there is  the option to also get it in a small cup. I do like that there are free cups for water for the taking at the register when you pay for your food and other drinks. They are also supposed to have baguettes available for purchase - a bit on the high end at $3 but hey, a Euro style bakery option in walking distance of my house so I'm not complaining.

It also feels strange that their espresso does not come with a side of sugar so if you want it sweeter, get it off the side area (though they only had non-sugar substitutes when I was there but once again, newly opened). I'll be there at least once a week for a morning pastry and coffee drink so I'll see them work it out.

The one thing I hope they are working on is a liquor license as it is a shame not to sit out on the patio, near the piazza style area with a nice bottle of wine and maybe, if someone from there is reading this, until then they will provide a BYOB option with a corkage fee?  

Other than that, a lovely place that I think will only grow in popularity and its nice to come back from Europe and find a little slice of Euro style living, right in my own backyard - Viva la Delice Bistro!

Update - went back today - service is still a work in progress as the owner works on developing the operational flow for the place but I did buy a whole grain baguette and it was amazing - little poppy seeds throughout that added a wonderful nutty flavor and the crust was chewy and crisp - I will definately buy them on a regular basis.","review","aIAjAU-6NH583EkQ6E9KRw",0,0,1,"Delice Bistro","Food,Desserts,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",2,9,1,1,13,4,5,12,5,25

I am not a hater I have a Macbook Pro and am from hipster land myself so I am not judging, but I am pointing out that when I sat down it was aluminum computer galore.

Coffee is solid with the normal 5 star ""coffee shop"" amenities: Pour over, drip, french press, espresso, etc. with a coffee menu to choose your beans for you drink sort of thing. 

Price or value was right in line with nothing really out of the ordinary.

The food is amazing, the coffee is great, and the atmosphere is everything you are looking for...BUT the service is terrible.  I have gone three times, each time the service is awful.  The first time it was just slow, no big deal, it was the girls second day.  The second time I was ignored for 10 minutes, then the girl forgot my drink order (It was coffee with soy milk).  Then this weekend I tried it again.

It was stormy outside and the perfect day to sip coffee, eat breakfast, and shop at Bunky's.  I ordered a coffee (black this time) and the baked eggs with toast WITHOUT PROSCIUTTO.  I paid the $8 for eggs and toast without complaint since I was the person being difficult.  It took 15 minutes to get my coffee (remember its just plain drip coffee), no big deal, I can wait. Then another 20 minutes after I received my coffee the guy comes by with my eggs and toast, covered in prosciutto.  He asks if this is my order and I tell him I ordered it without the meat.  He says, ""oh, then I will bring you a side plate."" I tell him that isn't what I want, and that I don't eat meat.  To this he responds with indignation, ""what are you allergic?"" I tell him no I am a vegetarian.  He then says, ""ok well I will go just pick it off.""  At that point I get a refund and call in an order to Matt's Big Breakfast for pick up.  It was only a 15 minute wait, was without meat, and was served with a smile.  Hoping that someone reads this and give the staff some much needed customer service training.  Matt is a talented chef and restaurateur hoping that this problem is fixed.

I have read many a review of the place and of course walked by it several times.  From the outside, it seems so unattainable.  It is a cafe situated on top of a cafe.  It almost seemed intimidating, like it was saying: ""Yeah, we're a cafe... but are you located 5 meters above ground level?  That's what I thought. Peasant!""  The pleasant looking plants in the windows didn't help the ""not a college student atmosphere"" vibe it was putting out.

I was shocked, however, upon entering to find a spacious cafe catering to a wide demographic (by ""wide demographic"" I don't mean ""fat people""... sorry fat people).  When you enter, you walk up a set wide stairs (sorry fat stairs) which ends with a series of old glass windows which time has rendered wavy and hard to see through.  From there you enter a vast expanse of... erm... well cafe.

It's a seat yourself kind of deal, with tables in a variety of sizes and shapes and newspaper coveredness.  It has kind of a quirkiness to it that makes you feel right at home instantly.  (Oh, it doesn't.... that's just me?  *Sobs quietly to self*)

Now, people have been raving about the prices, and I won't disagree... mostly because I can't.  I only had a coffee, which ran me about ¬£1.95.  I've had much cheaper coffee, but then again I've also had much crappier coffee.  So it's not the cheapest cup o' joe in the city, sue me (don't), but the atmosphere and quality make up for the inflated price tag, I feel.","review","GI7P_KFt48ciMrYZ2JG2rg",0,3,0,"Spoon","Food,Brasseries,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants",4,7,2,1,6,4,4,10,7,13

i love this branch of cafe marlayne as the front is a cute little cafe type seating.  there's a counter with cakes and a coffee machine and big comfy couches with cosy looking arms chairs as well.  then you walk through to the restaurant and theres loads of light and tables and gorgeous green printed wall paper and a happy buzz of contented diners.  i was impressed that despite it being a cold and rather snowy day out the restaurant was warm and cosy with lots of light.

the menu on mothering sunday was lovely and had too many good options to choose from.  we actually had to send the waiter away twice while we made final decisions.  i decided on the hake with butternut squash puerre and a caper sauce.  i added some mashed potatoes for good measure as well.  the other orders were two sirlion burgers and the toulouse sausage.

dishes took a bit of time to arrive which reassured me that everything was made fresh to order.  although i did have a bit of food envy watching the table across from us getting served their meals.  luckily ours arrived not too long after and i soon had in front of me a lovely plate of pan fried hake atop a lovely puerre of bright orange butternut squash with spinach mixed in and caper sauce.  also a bowl for creamy mashed potatoes that were just delicious i never wanted to finish them!  but the real star of my dish was that butternut squash...it was just OMG....  i feel there may have been loads of butter mixed into it, but it was sooooo incredibly tasty and went incredibly well with the hake.  the whole dish was perfect and i made sure to leave my plate clean.  all our plates were clean in fact and everyone seemed very pleased with their dishes.

since we had forgone the starter in favour of cake after our mains, we then had the taks of deciding which one to get.  there was a board of about 7-8 cakes to chose from!  i went with the white chocolate and pistachio cake which was lovely and not too sweet.  i definitely enjoyed it as i also did the taste of baked lime cheesecake i got.  the meal was ended with a cup of tea that arrived in a massive teapot for two people.  i could have gotten at least three cups out of it which is perfect for me, the more tea the better!!

so another excellent meal at cafe marlayne and i definitely look forward to visiting again.  i love that i've never had the same dish twice and there are always so many delicious options to choose from.  only four stars though as service was a wee bit slow and it took ages to get someone to pay attention to us to get the bill.","review","hWD_PTfJUXjIYb1UJ0wNFg",1,0,2,"Caf√© Marlayne","Food,Coffee & Tea,French,Restaurants",0,20,0,1,29,4,8,25,3,41

A gourmet cafe, Sambalatte serves up espresso drinks and single origin, via pour or vacuum.  Got to watch the barista make the vacuum coffee several times.  It does take awhile and it is best to ask baristas on the single origin they have for the day.  My go-to here is the iced latte.  Espresso here is great and love the milk they use here.  Milk is very milky but the flavors of the espresso still comes through.

There's also some food items, but selection's not too big.  Ham & cheese croissant is great and the chocolate croissant is tasty when warmed up.  I do find myself getting food at McD after getting a drink here though.

I'm definitely not a shredded coconut lover, but his coconut gelato converted me!  The intense coconut flavor is simply heavenly, best gelato ever!

- Good soy lattes made of Godshot.
- The ""caf√© de quartier"" ambiance.
- They are using local coffee beans, from St-Henri.
- And, there's ""un je ne sais quoi"" that makes me feel happy there! ;)
- Free wi-fi by ""ilesansfil""

I bought 6 cupcakes for a birthday dinner (chocolate, chocolate oreo, red velvet, lemon, mixed berry, and coconut). I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by the taste, and texture of all of the flavors. The cupcakes were dry, dense, and had very little flavor. The overall presentation of the cupcakes was very cute, and they were decorated wonderfully, however that did not make up for the taste. After paying over $3 a cupcake I was really expecting something better. I was almost embarrassed to serve these to my friends and family. I will give it two stars because it was a nice little coffee shop in a great location. I can only base this review off of the cupcakes, I haven't tried any of their other food, but I sure do hope that the rest of their menu tastes better than their cupcakes.","review","r2fe5wG4krrZUmGmJCQolQ",0,0,1,"The Coffee Shop","Food,Sandwiches,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",1,4,2,0,5,1,3,5,3,9

Pros:
1 - The drinks and the sandwiches are good! That's pretty darned important for a cafe and sadly many other cafes can't say that.
2 - There is usually seating
3 - OPEN 24 HOURS! Seriously, with Vegas's reputation as the all day, all night city I thought everything would be open 24 hours. Not even close! Thankful for this place at odd hours
4 - Staff is mostly friendly and usually get the order correct
5 - Outside seating is available. Nice when it's not a hundred and hell degrees.
6 - There's a park right across the street so with that and the mountains, they have a nice view

Cons:
1 - Despite what everyone says, Wi-fi in NOT free. You have to buy a minimum amount and then get a code for a set amount of hours. Come on guys! I get it, you want people to buy and not stay if they aren't spending, but it's not costing you anything to let people use the internet. This isn't 1998. 
2 - It's expensive. A large iced white mocha is about $7. That's kind of ridiculous, and yet, I pay...
3 - The owner is always around. That's not bad, per se, but he has loud conversations, plays on his laptop with the sound up, that kind of stuff. 
4 - Pastries aren't too yummy. They're okay, but that's as excited as I'm going to get about it.

So, if you have the money come on over! You can not go wrong with any of the ""all time favorite"" drinks...unless you're diabetic, then just say no.

I had the flatbread off the appetizer menu. It's large, the size of a pizza, and not that flat, really. I enjoyed the toppings and the chewy texture of the bread. It was quite dry, though, since it had no sauce and just chunks of cheese and tomato. I still enjoyed it. (At home, I heated up my leftovers, added salad greens, and a balsamic drizzle. The balsamic was awesome and fixed the dryness problem.)

My husband had the triple double pizza. To quote the menu: ""San Marzano tomatoes, hot & sweet sausage, red bell pepper, pepperoncini, mozzarella and monterey jack.""

Dang that's good stuff-  the Milk Way has espresso, caramel sauce (who doesn't love that?) and chocolate blend milk. Yummy! 

Each time I have visited this location it has been about 9:30-10:00 on a Saturday night and the same dude has been working. He is fast, friendly and talkative. Must be kind of lonely sitting in a box in the parking lot all night, but fortunately for him the location seems to be popular. 

I didn't go five stars because the cup is a little hot. No little cardboard ring for insulation and I find it is challenging to drive without letting it cool down slightly. But otherwise, excellent.

I enjoy the experience of coming here more so than Starbucks and I can't wait to come back - good thing my next play is this Saturday night. Bring on the Dutch Brothers!","review","zCC6huLkNBEr3JUgQyxJbg",1,1,0,"Dutch Bros Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,9,1,1,9,1,2,11,3,13

IMO, the only time anyone should frequent a big name coffee shop is in Seattle, otherwise, skip it. It doesn't taste the same outside of WA. I highly recommend the Black and White.

You're like that ex-girlfriend one keeps going back to after the breakup is long past. You know the kind, the kind that keeps coming back begging for ""another"" second chance, saying she's sorry, saying she'll change, saying things will be different this time.  And you, you take her back again, not because you think this time will be different, but because deep down you're still in love with her and when you're together it's ""Oh-So-Good"".  But just about the time you really want her, really need her...Poof...She's gone.  Leaving you with another broken heart and lying there in a puddle of heartache and salty tears next to an empty bottle of John Daniels wondering when, no if, if you'll ever see her again.

Lola Coffee, I love you!  You're great!  You're amazing!  You're everything I'd ever want in a coffee shop; great coffee, amazing pastries, and awesome and friendly barista's.  If I were single and you were a girl, you'd be my type.  But there's just this one little thing we're going to have to fix if this relationship were to work.  You see, I need you to be OPEN when I want coffee.  I work during the day.  I'd love the stop in at 10:30 for a nice steaming cup of your morning brew.  But I work across town, and someone has to earn a living.  After work, I'm tired. I'm hungry.  I go home and have a nice dinner.  It's then around 8:30, or 9:00 that I'd love to come in and have a cup or two, snuggle up with a good book or my laptop and do what people do in coffee shops.  But every time I'm out and about and think about dropping by, you're CLOSED!  

If only you'd stay open until, say, 10:00 every night, I'm sure that with Hula's, and Maizie's next door, you'd have plenty of business to make it profitable.  Not to mention the fact that you'd make one, actually two, coffee lovers very happy.

With heartfelt love,

It happened to be Chilly's 1 year anniversary the day we went. I had checked out their menu on Yelp and knew exactly what I wanted. I ordered the four piece Broasted Chicken Meal with Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad. One thing I wish they would have told us is it takes about 20 minutes for the chicken. The wait was well worth it. We were going to eat in, but after waiting our butts were hurting from the metal ( not big people friendly) chairs. 

When we got home we dug in! I first tried the the potato salad. Ick!!! I believe it had Miracle Whip in it!! (I absolutely hate that stuff) Next I tried the Mac & cheese it was ok, nothing special. Lacked flavor. Maybe if we had stayed and had it there it would have been better.

Now let's talk chicken!!! OMG Broasted Chicken! Yummy! Full of flavor and dripping with juices. I absolutely loved the wing and breast pieces and wished we had ordered just a big thing of chicken! Forget the sides! It also came with huge potato wedges and biscuits. They were ok, but trust me it's all about the chicken!!  

They also have frozen yogurt, which I'll be back to try. Also, I noticed they had tons of sugar free syrup options for their Italian sodas and ice cream.

The staff at Chilly's was friendly. I totally understand they had extra stuff going on when we were there (being that it was their one year anniversary), but I felt they were too busy taking pictures to help customers or make food.

You may ask, ""what's the difference"" or ""what's wrong with Starbucks"" and the simple answer is the dedication to the craft. Brewing good coffee or making a perfect latte is a craft... there are people who do it well and understand the nuances and there are people who have to follow a corporate formula in order to create a consistent experience across hundreds or thousands of locations. There is nothing inherently wrong with the corporate formula approach, but there is also something special about the independent shop that can make decisions on the types of beans, the brewing methods, the presentation, etc. and you can definitely taste the difference.

I went there this morning to grab a quick breakfast for my husband and myself, and I decided to avoid the drive thru and just go in. The food was decent and the coffee was good, but my issue was with the girl who took my order. She didn't know what ANYTHING was that I ordered. I asked if they served the coconut flavored coffee (it wasn't listed on their menu) and she looked at me like she was disgusted, and then asked someone if they served that. He told me that they did in fact serve the coconut coffee, and then went and got it for me. Thanks. So then I ordered my husbands sandwich, which was the eggs Benedict sandwich. Again, the girl behind the counter looks at me with utter confusion, and asks the same guy if they have that, and what it is, and then tells me she ""doesn't even know what that means"". So unfortunately they didn't serve this sandwich and I got something else for him- no big deal. She tells me my total which was $15 and some change, and when I jokingly replied that I was shocked (we got a a few other things so I wasn't expecting it to to be 5 bucks!), this girl looks at me and say ""I know right?"" I didn't reply because I didn't know where she was going with that, but she went ahead and continued anyway by saying, ""honestly, I work here and I think that the prices of things are way to high for the quality of our stuff"". Woooooooooooooow. Now I'm really confident about the food and coffee I ordered!

The BBQ chicken wrap was made with shredded chicken I imagine was cooked same day in house, very much unlike some places with cubed, bagged, frozen then thawed chicken pieces. It was served warm, which was kind of a surprise, but as it turns out a nice one. 

The chicken pot pie was, as others have mentioned, delightful. I hadn't had chicken pot pie in a while, but it really hit the spot on a cold and cloudy day. There was a lot of chicken though, I'm sure that's most people's preference, but I wish it was more veggie heavy.

On top of all of that, their staff was courteous, and they serve coke products which is always a win for me.

I wanted to surprise my now-wife with a trip to Vegas, and also made the decision that I was going to purchase her ring and propose while there.  Long story short, I got the ring, but then didn't want to hold on to it any longer than necessary, so went and proposed right then and there at the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace.  Probably not every girl's fantasy, but it did work out quite well.

What may have been lacking in romance there, I'd like to think I made up for with a post-proposal trip to Petrossian.  It's a great little place where you can get a bottle of Dom and some of the world's finest caviar brought to you.  It still ranks as the most money I've ever spent for a meal (and if you look at my reviews, that's saying something), but it was the perfect way to celebrate that most special of occasions.","review","ARlAnV0FRlM9Pgv57eESbw",2,1,0,"Petrossian Bar","Food,Bars,Coffee & Tea,Nightlife,Lounges",1,5,0,3,6,2,6,4,2,7

I understand they are busy but a quick ""hi, I'll be right with you"" would suffice. I'm a patient person, I don't mind waiting. But not to be acknowledged as the baristas go about ringing up the drive thru and making the drive thru coffee order is a bit rude.

I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.

My tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.

The prices are brilliant with drinks on average being a lot cheaper compared to your normal Edinburgh bar. And what is even better is that this student union always has a great atmosphere and lots of things to do. The building is impressive as well.

Teviot has a number of bars ranging from the busy Library bar, to the Sportsman Bar and to the cosmopolitan Loft Bar. All of the bars have their own atmosphere and each attract different types of students. The Middle Bar is more a quiet, laid back bar which attracts older students or societies, whilst the Library bar always attracts the more going out type of student.

There is live music, a pub quiz and a night dedicated to board games each week. Furthermore, Teviot is always busy at the festival time.

Tucked inside the Pavilion in Southend, crazy art on the walls, banners, notes written in sharpie, mismatched chairs, rocking chairs, and an odd layout to boot. Needless to say, it's PERFECT. My kind of spot for a good breakfast or any time, for that matter. It's like a Common Market met a grungy record shop and then decided to focus on bagels. I just love this place. 

Parking can feel a bit odd since there aren't many spaces out front and it's so close to South Blvd. I'd park where ever you can find an open space. 

The menu is extensive with tons of crazy concoctions. There are plenty of more breakfast-style choices but tons that will appeal to the lunch bunch as well. My favorite for an anytime or good breakfast -- Mary's Grubby Bubby. Tomato, avocado, egg, and muenster. I was stoked to see they had some bialy left, too! Tried it on for size and it was amazing. I love making bialy at home and Owen's really hit the spot. 

Though I didn't grab a cup of coffee with my breakfast, the roaster they use out of Raleigh had bottles of cold brew in the cooler. Love trying new cold brews and loved that Owen's had this for sale. Picked up a bottle on the way out. 

The service is great. Homeboy was nice and took care of like 6 people after I ordered mine. That guy had some hustle, too. He then came out and took care of the entire room while everyone was eating. One man teams like that are hard to come by. My hat's off to you, my friend.

Aisha said has been in business for 6 months and doing OK. She gets most business through word of mouth. I did suggest I would have enjoyed seeing a website for the place, and Aisha said she is working on this.

The atmosphere is very pretentious considering this place is pretty much in the middle of the barrio... The seating inside is horrible.... It is one big long table and everyone gets seated next to each other. I was deeply immersed in the conversations of the groups to my left and my right.  The group on my right were going to watch a show after dinner and the group on my left just got back from a trip and they were meeting up with a friend for Vietnam. I made up stories about getting a sex change operation just to mess with everyone because if I heard them then sure as hell heard me. 

I went here with my mom after we visited the Botanical Gardens. The outside looks like it could be a local dive bar... When you go in everything is dark... I hated it... The kitchen is open so you see them cooking the food and you can hear all the dishes making noise. The client√®le seemed like they were more middle-upper class but they were all weirdos... It is one thing to watch the Real Housewives of Orange County but you can't pretend to be the Real Housewives of Orange County.

Thank God the sangrias are good. They get 1 star for their sangrias... the other star was for the flavor of the food. It was good... I really like the Paella... They did not get anymore stars because the server got our order wrong and failed to bring us one of the dishes we ordered. Oh and she gave us bread with olive oil... No balsamic vinegar... I had to ask for it... WTF???  Did I mention how she made us feel like we did not belong there... Excuse me miss I work for tips. You messed with the wrong Diva today!!! So I ended tipping her $1.00... on a $90 bill. My mom was embarrassed but I am not running for Mrs. Congeniality so be glad I even left a tip. *Evil Laugh* 

Oh and they do not have diet coke... WTF? It is 2010... Doesn't every place have a diet soda.  They said they have Lemon Aid.... Um... Diet Soda is not Lemon Aid. Another WTF moment!

Also one last thing to bag on them about... The waitress told us they had specials but when we read the menu the specials were just the same thing. I even asked if there was something different and she said no. To this day I wonder what made them special if they were part of the regular menu.

BTW this place is all tapas so everything is on little plates. Not sure why people are surprised.  That is a given considering the name of the place. Price was in-line with the quality of the food.... don' get me started on the service though.  I am now taking away 1 of the 2 stars I gave them just because I had to think about the service we got and it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. 

I hope you have a better experience at this place and less ""WTF"" moments. LOL","review","f2aH-hqBtQLMGegUsJvi9g",0,0,0,"Lola","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,11,5,8,14,3,7,15,10,17

Dean and Deluca rocks that decade with panache, and not even an inkling of shame. Awesome.

Nevermind that the cheeses have no prices posted. Nevermind that things here (vinegar, certain brands of truffle oil, falafel chips, bouillion) are twice as much as they are at neighboring and (shockingly) more affordable Earth Fare, even.

Small, selective section of kitchen implements - not meant to be of use in dire need, but trends - microplanes and zesters, mezzalunas. Spotless shelves in perfect order. Truffled products of every imaginable use - nori salt - the olive bar might be the only thing here leaning towards pedestrian. Chico-and-Nordstrom's-clad ladies abound. Service can be icy, but always well informed. Is the coffee superlative? Not at all, but it's not obscenely priced either.

A quick note on the cheese counter - large and global, and the few times I've bought a hunk, it had obviously been well cared for, but EF's, down the street, is larger and more locally focused. Go there instead.

Would I shop here regularly? If I made so much money that a 50 percent mark up on standard exotics didn't ruffle my feathers, maybe. It's clean, classy, well staffed, culinarily inspiring.

Reason for the two star rating is the staffs' disregard for health codes regarding animals.  The ONLY reason an animal would be allowed in the restaurant is if it's a service animal.  This morning multiple employees were oooing and ahing a tiny dog brought in by a customer.  This is not the first time I've seen this here.  When I questioned the cashier about it, she told me it was okay as long as it didn't touch the floor.  WRONG.  Cuteness does not justify violating health code.  And before you start to think I'm an animal hater, I have two dogs.  Guess where I do not take them... Any and all restaurants.  Pets should stay home.

Never really been a fan of sitting in a corporate place like Starbucks, I find myself searching for a like place without all of the corporate mumbo jumbo.  In Scottsdale, I think I've found that place in the Coffee Bean on the corner of Miller and Indian School Rd.
 Set with ample inside and outside seating, the Coffee Bean maintains that traditional coffee house look with it's tables for those who wish to log on to their computers, or couches for those who like to sit around with friends.  The couches are perfectly placed right by the window looking out at the corner streets.  The outside seating is quite lovely too.  The setting is great for those who like to sit out in the sun or if someone just like sitting in the shade to just get some fresh air.  Outside seating is available for those who would prefer the parking lot view, or the cars racing by street view, and smoking is aloud in both.
 OK, enough about what you get when you walk in and look around, most people go to a place like this for one reason: coffee and maybe a snack.  The house blends are very nice.  There are three choices to choose from, one for those who like strong and bold coffee, one for those who prefer a lighter coffee, and a decaf.  Being a bold person, I choose the Columbian Dark.  Full in flavor, it was fantastic with a dash of cinnamon that you can get from self serve condiment bar (which was very clean.)  Some don't want plain jane coffee, so the latte is another option.  I ordered one of these too, so if the review seems a little flustered, it's the caffeine...mmm, coffee.  It was nicely flavored and quite hot and wonderful for a cool Arizona morning.  The menu also offers a nice selection of iced coffees and iced teas for those not so cool days in Arizona (you know, the other 364 days of the year.)
 The Coffee Bean also had some tasty confections to eat, and eat I did.  The pastry window had a good, not great variety of morning foods and pastries, but the brownie caught my eye.  I ordered one and had the option of having it heated up.  I did choose against it, because I didn't want it to feel like I was eating a dessert.  Cold pastry=good for breakfast, hot pastry=good for dessert.  The piece I had delivered to me was so big, I knew that I wasn't going to need to eat anything else until dinner.  If I where worried about my weight, I would've shared it, but I would've done so with kicking and screaming the whole way, it was that good.
 The service was great, and they were kind enough to fix my latte, when I was a knucklehead and placed my order wrong, for free.  I would recommend this place for anyone like me who likes to hang out for days on end getting juiced on caffeine, or for those who want a quick pick me up in the morning.  Prices were about the same as any other coffee shop, but the ambiance of the place makes the Coffee Bean my new dealer of the caffeinated liquid drug that gets me through each day and on to the next review.","review","J9_QRGpKaLmOb24L5W3PIg",1,1,1,"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf","Food,Coffee & Tea",4,8,2,2,15,4,8,18,6,33

ATMOSPHERE: Cute shop with plenty of seating. Clean and nice like most things in the Bellagio.
PRODUCT: Huge selection! We ordered pistachio and tiramasu with chunks of tiramasu yummy! Both were excellent and served in ample amounts. Served in a cute Bellagio plastic cup. We kept ours for a souvenir.
SERVICE: Excellent. No complaints here. Samplings given as requested.
PRICES: $6 (large size, 2 scoops), which is very reasonable for Vegas gelato so far that I have found.  
CONCLUSION: Good quality and amount and thus, reasonably priced. I would come here again!

I had the breakfast combo which was egg omelet bacon panini, OJ and coffee.

The panini was not too bad, probably would order something else next time. Croissant, fresh out of oven, was delicious. Curry chicken quiche.. yummy! Seasoning was right on spot. 

The pricing for all of us was under $16 I believe. My dad originally wanted to eat at one of those buffet on the strip and it was $15 per person for breakfast (but meh, I'm not a fan of buffets).

Now open for less than a week. I wanted someone to write a glowing review of this place which makes me want to give them another try. To my dismay, no one has come forth with that yet. 

The issue I had with the product is that their espresso based drinks are not very good. I am not a fan of sugary drinks. I like my coffee to be strong, black, and unmasked. Usually my go to drink is an Americano and prefer it on ice during the summer. When I got my drink, it confused me because it looked like ice tea. When I took a sip, it was clear that it was not very bold. My friend had got a cappuccino and was not happy with it either. When I tried it, it was more like warm milk. 

Right now they are running a special. If you purchase two drinks, it comes with a pastry. We got a seven layer bar to split. It is good, but too much for one person. This massive bar is dense and rich. It was an enjoyable treat. 

Besides the typical cafe drinks and snacks, they do sell sandwiches. I didn't take a close look because I had already eaten.

While I find the entrance a little too tight (when you open the door you have 2, maybe 3 meters before the ordering counter), I find the overall horizontal design of the cafe compensates for this entrance flaw. More importantly, the variety of chairs, couches, and sofa chairs gives options to the patrons here, along with a moderate amount of power jacks for those running electronic devices that need a constant power draw.

The baristas here are very friendly and will be chatty with you, providing valuable insight of the surrounding area, areas of interest depending on what you are looking for.

The clientele here is varied, if you are a people person like me. I have seen elderly couples here already at 7 PM, but I also have seen students of various edges step in and out for a quick coffee, from the nearby dance studio next door.

I've seen middle aged couples come in, along with people of my age group (23-29) pop in to just grab a cup of fancy Starbucks joe and sit down to study or read off a Kindle.

All in all, I think this place definitely gets the job done, and the Google powered wifi here gives this place a major plus that most Starbucks do not have. (Seriously, AT&T wifi is crap, it can barely support ten users at a time, Google hotspots are FAR more powerful).

I may or may not come here in the future. I think there are other Starbucks I want to venture to first.

I was here for breakfast, and had the sausage, cheddar, and egg on an toasted everything bagel with breakfast potatoes.  The sandwich was large, and the egg was at least half of it.  The sausage was nice thick country sausage.  But, the bagel lacked the garlic and onion flavor an everything bagel typically has.  It was just average, maybe below given that it's an everything bagel and supposed to have those flavors.

The breakfast potatoes were likewise a disappointment.  You get a TON of them, it filled up a large styrofoam container.  But, there was no seasoning on them.  They are served with onions and peppers, but they needed more.  It was about 85% potato.  

Also, this meal, with a small fountain drink, was $11.  That's too high in my opinion, but I understand they probably pay a good amount in rent and are the only place to get food in the center, so you should expect to pay more than you would for the same meal at a stand alone restaurant.

I had heard about this place before and while I was window shopping at the mall I came across Teavana. When I lived in Germany I used to drink this tea that was some sort of a vanilla flavored green tea but I couldn't find it here anywhere. So, when I found this store, I got really excited and walked up to the counter to ask about it. The lady behind the counter told me they didn't have vanilla flavored green tea, which made me a little sad. Then she told me that I could buy green tea and honeyboosh tea, well then I was happy again, even though she seemed really confused about me asking her to mix those teas for me. 

Then I asked what the prices were for the green tea and the honeyboosh, but she didn't tell me, instead she tried to talk me into buying the tin. Well, I told her that I just needed some tea and that I wasn't interested in the tin. So she scoops a little bit of the green tea in the little bag on the scale and tells me that we are at $28 and my jaw almost dropped. I asked if they had a cheaper green tea, but they didn't. At that point I was very disappointed and sad again. I don't know, maybe I'm a cheap a** but paying about $40 for only 4 oz of tea, no matter how good, just doesn't mix well with what I'm making right now. And believe me, I have traveled a lot and have had many good teas.

The staff was super patient, walking us through the many options that we had (as I don't really ever buy retail items from any coffee shop), and joking with us about what we should get as the ""free drink"". I settled on a blended Black Forrest with Soy. It was the ""filet Mignon"" of drinks (one of the most expensive drinks). As usual, the staff was happy to substitute with Soy milk and the drink was made quickly. The drink was pretty damn amazing at that. Probably one of the best frozen blended drinks I've ever had.

The Stout flavor is of Guiness with Malted Chocolate, talk about adult indulgence! I then saw underneath the flavor, The Hangover (Helper) which the lovely gal offered just as I finished eyeing it. This my friends is a total win! It's a whiskey-vanilla based ice cream with corn flakes, very similar to Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast in San Francisco.

Is the coffee bad? No, it's not.  It's ok.  The iced chai I had was a bit too iced to the point of almost being frozen.  And the taste was kind of blah.  But did that bother me? Not at all.  The name of the place is called Bikini Beans Espresso.  Notice that coffee is the last thing mentioned in the business name.  

I guess this place was all on the news when it opened, I had no clue.  My girlfriend mentioned it to me after we had breakfast. And being a guy, I couldn't even sugarcoat it and lie about wanting to go and try it out.  

It was cool how the cup sizes for a drink are actual bra cup sizes.  A 16oz is a A cup, 24oz I believe is a B, so on and so forth.  

I didn't know what to expect when we got to the window.  Perhaps some girls in respectable one piece bikinis.  To where they look nice enough to still be respected for earning a honest living as barista and not subjected to being sex objects.  HHEEELLLLLLOOOOO!!!  Man was I wrong! The girl leaned over in a tiny two piece bikini where the top didn't leave much to the imagination.  She was very easy on the eyes, they all were which I imagine you have to be if your working at a place like that.  She was very professional, nice and friendly.  After they took my order the girl told us to pull around to the other side of the building to pick up our order.  DOUBLE HHHHHHEEEELLLLLLOOOOO!!!!  Were greeted by a backside in bright green bikini bottom that again leaves little to the imagine.  

As I'm with my girlfriend waiting for my coffee and trying not to stare at this girl who obviously must do squats in her sleep and every time she stops at a red light while driving.  She handed me my coffee and was very sweet.  That's when my girlfriend leaned over me and told the girl that she had a very nice a$$.  Imagine that! My girlfriend not me was the one who couldn't contain her excitement at the eye candy at Bikini Beans Espresso.

Of course I will go again.  I see that they offer smoothies as well, so I would like to try one of those.  The place still needs quite a bit more improvement.  I swear it looked like they just had a blender in there and that's it. I'm not sure if the place will last though.  People are going for the novelty cause that's not normally something you see.  But if the coffee doesn't improve I could see people looking elsewhere for their coffee fix.  Unless of course your a high school kid.","review","XPTJfl_t4n18_PUM2GSytA",5,19,8,"Bikini Beans Espresso","Food,Coffee & Tea",4,10,5,2,10,7,5,15,10,23

Part of what I look for in a coffee shop is service, which was sorely lacking both times. My latte was not great, but I've had worse. The milk definitely needed to be aerated better, though.

If you need a place to study for school or do some work, and maybe want a sandwich or something, this place is great. Someone mentioned the low volume of the music--it is true, it was very quiet. Personally, I actually prefer louder music, but I had my headphones, so it was okay.

Some of the other (apparent) employees (or maybe even owners?) seemed friendly enough, but the unfriendly service from that one girl is enough to keep me from coming back.

It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?

Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said ""SURE!"" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? ""SURE! But be careful it's hot."" And oh so YUM!

I think they deserve the taglines ""Have it your way"" and ""Any way you want it"" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said ""No"" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.

Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.

But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.

My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.

The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters. 

The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.  

I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was ""it's called black and blue"".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.  

The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.

Inside is clean and organized with cute wooden wicker seating and lots of cute art posted on the walls. There's even a water spout with lemons and oranges cut up inside for self-serve hydration. Pastries in case look tasty- almost got an onion tart or a fruit tart but opted instead for the Croque Monseiur sandwich, as suggested by the cashier, along with an iced white chocolate mocha.

Sandwich was very rich and indulgent- as it typically is. Flavors were tasty but sandwich itself didn't sit well with me. Was plated with a small side salad with a tasty house-made dressing. Coffee was iced, sweetened, and caffeinated, which is exactly why I got it.

Side note about the music: initially came in to a few rap/club style songs playing?, but the music eventually returned to quieter more caf√©-appropriate selections. Odd. There's a nice patio that is shaded from the sun setting behind the building- would be nice for spring or fall dining alfresco but in this summer heat it likely wont be used often.","review","9A2-wSoBUxlMd3LwmlGrrQ",6,6,8,"La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Caf√©","Food,Bakeries,Coffee & Tea,Cafes,Restaurants",0,5,0,1,6,4,2,6,5,14

While the desserts there has *sounded* good, the dinner wasn't, so my companion and I chose to walk to Chocolaterian. The day had been drizzly and overcast, so I was looking forward to a cozy setting and a warm beverage. Chocolaterian delivered on both counts. There was plenty of space, and the tables weren't crowded together. There were several big windows on two of the restaurant's walls, which let in a nice amount of natural light. The baking cases, tables, and floors were all well-cleaned, and the surroundings did a good job of dampening any noise. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked. The woman behind the counter gave us some recommendations, and also pointed out the half-priced dessert case in case we wanted to keep our visit frugal. The lower prices were a plus; some items do seem overpriced (though given the butter prices lately, it's understandable). We chose a caramel tart and a chocolate-raspberry tart to share, and I ordered a piping hot cup of mint tea.

The caramel tart was delicious, although the crust was a bit tough and slightly thick where the sides met the bottom. The caramel was gooey without being a mess, and the cashews on top provided a salty richness that I always welcome when eating caramel. My companion, not usually a fan of caramel, stole more bites than I thought he would. His chocolate-raspberry tart was still moist and delicious, despite it being half-priced. The raspberry flavor was very well-incorporated, and added a nice hint of acidity to even out the richness of the chocolate. It also didn't taste artificial or too much like raspberry preserves, which was a welcome change from what usually happens when I order something with raspberry flavor. The tea was fantastic as well, hot and flavorful. It needed no added sugar and was very welcome given the weather outside.

Thats because on those rare Scottish sunny days, I would forgive you for thinking you were actually in Italy - or at least thats how it felt as soon as we took the plunge and grabbed on of the quickly filling seats outside Made in Italy.

From the moment we sat down, we felt as though we were in authentic Italy - a real Italian waitress who was impossibly charming greated us and took our orders. The food was fantastic - my pizza not only being square, but thin and crispy with a delicious topping of mozzarella and vine tomatoes - yum!

The coffee we then moved onto - we were reliably informed - was award winning, what ever that means - but it did taste damn good.

Overall, the experience was of like a small slice of Italy being placed in Edinburgh - and the weather brought with it.","review","SIfJLNMv7vBwo-fSipxNgg",0,0,0,"Made In Italy","Food,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants,Italian",2,6,3,2,8,2,6,7,4,12

The second time I came here, they were on point and with a few cars in front of me it was relatively fast.

I'm not sure how they can use this claim to fame and it is a bit disappointing. 

It's always incredibly busy and there's often big queues so I avoid it for that reason, but I went in the other day with a friend. They have a sign saying you need to wait to be seated. I was a little reluctant to buy coffee and then find there was no seat but when I asked the waiter he said there would be. I presumed he or someone anyway would show us to a seat, but after we bought our coffees it seemed to be a case of find seats yourself, although my friend ended up asking. I think if they're going to have this sign they should follow through and be there to seat people, rather than letting them stand there aimlessly wondering if they can sit at a table with other people they don't know.","review","Mjfc9jAPCFbIyW4Cmr11JA",0,1,3,"The Elephant House","Food,Brasseries,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",1,2,0,3,3,3,1,4,6,10

We tried the orchard french toast and biscuits and gravy.  Both were solid solid dishes!  At about $10 each, I think the french toast could have used another slice though.

I used to live across the street from this place.. literally.  & when I did, I used to come here a few times a week.

-The drinks were always good and consistent.  
-Never too long of a wait time. 
-Good menu---even better that you can mix flavors together.
-They offer ramen and diamond ice (paht bing soo/shaved ice)
-Decently priced.

Favorite flavors:
-Mocha Smoothie w/ boba
-Mango, pineapple, strawberry smoothie w/ boba
-Honeydew smoothie w/boba
-Passionfruit slush w/boba

*only drinks I'd be hesitating on ordering is the flavored milk teas?  I once had the strawberry milk tea & it was disgusting.  They clearly do not make it like the other boba shops do...

Shop itself is pretty cool.  There's tagging and grafitti all over the walls.  It's cool to come back after a couple years and see that your mark is still there.

I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn.

Customer Service.  8/10.  Assistant manager was great, knowledgeable, helpful.
Taste.  2/10.  Misugaru latte tasted like drinking dissolved chalk in water.  Classic Arnold palmer was a very badly conceived balance of tea to lemonade.  Honey bread was 99% standard dry bread.  Though it tasted okay, the dryness from the rest of the bread overtook any toppings added to it.
Value.  1/10.  Honey bread is probably something close to a 2000% markup on ingredients.  Cannot go here regularly without breaking the bank.  If the taste and quality and consistency of the drinks was commensurate with the price, then that'd be different since the upcharge would be tied to a higher level of enjoyment from a higher quality product.  But it seems like they are peddling cheap and badly made drinks and food, for outrageous prices.

Going once a year is probably a good bet for this place.  Going too often will make you poor, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth (if the food and drink hasn't already), because you feel as though you've paid for a meal and a drink, but have been given a hodgepodge of 10 cent ingredients prettied up to look good.

Drinks are good and food is average. It really depends how familiar you are with tea and other items. I love taro and their hot taro milk tea (without the boba) is simply, going back to 90's slang, the bomb. I like their ginger and jasmin tea. It's a bit strong, though. Prices are a bit high for some damn tea. I always buy the smallest portion available. Food isn't good enough to be recommended, so stick to drinks. 

Lastly, I have an issue with their bench seating against the wall. Maybe it's me and my bony ass, but it's extremely uncomfortable and hard.

"YppzR-sn8y15dmUd1lLcfw","2011-11-19","swya8Jua9PXd-pp3RWNYZQ",5,"Having recently moved down from the pacific northwest, I've been looking for a place to capture the coffeehouse vibe that is along every other block in Portland or Seattle.  While the neighborhoods in Las Vegas are not nearly as quirky and lined with independent small businesses or have the weirdly hot baristas with the tattoos and piercings that would ordinarily be deal-breakers for me, Sambalatte Torrefazione definitely has it's own community vibe and decor which makes it a welcome caffeinated oasis both on a hot sunny day as well as a windy overcast day.  This place succeeds on so many levels where Expresso in the SE part of town comes up short.

My first trip there occurred after work and I immediately gravitated towards the Nutella Latte.   I challenge someone to name something that doesn't immediately become more awesome with Nutella.  Nutella is like the ridiculously gorgeous girl towards whom guys are unable to make the comment, ""She's not my type"" since she is clearly everyone's type (i.e. pairs well with anything).  As I patiently waited for my beverage, I soaked in the scene with a young woman playing cover tunes on her acoustic guitar ranging from Michelle Branch and Norah Jones to Lady Gaga and Sheryl Crowe, taking sips of her latte in between and a few couches within a few feet for folks wanting the up close unplugged experience.  There were some nice patio chairs outside with umbrellas, and inside, the first floor has a bowling alley layout with a string of two seaters on your right, a nice long table accompanying 6-8 with multiple plug outlets for the studious on their laptops, and some circular tables in the middle for power lunches and casual get-togethers.  There is a staircase at the back leading to a second floor with an open room presumably for larger social gatherings, but I didn't get a chance to scope it out.  Aside from the diverse coffee and tea offerings, there was a beautiful display of pastries, desserts and colorful Parisian macarons, as well as soups/sandwiches/salads for a light meal, and a cozy little gelato bar with interesting flavors such as coconut and mango.  

When my name was called and I took my first sip, the thought occurred that this Nutella Latte should be renamed the Nutellatte (trademark pending).  Rich, creamy, and nutty without being overpoweringly sweet, I definitely plan on pairing it with one of their delectable food offerings the next time I return.  Great mix of people, servers were attentive and polite, and architecture is unique and comforting.  Bonus points for free wifi (no time limit from what I could tell), 10 for 1 beverage punchcard, and I noticed they even have their own mobile phone app available for download off their website.  Hopefully there will be more cafes like these springing up across town, but I will be totally content if this is my sole getaway to recapture my days in the northwest.","review","uO8iD4P9kHpzkSXLLK27bA",4,2,5,"Sambalatte Torrefazione","Food,Coffee & Tea,American (New),Cafes,Restaurants",2,14,1,1,10,2,9,10,9,22

Look, I love bagels. I love breakfast. They delivered on this front, and earned that 1 star. I unfortunately also appreciate customer service and cleanliness. When you fail to deliver on that, I don't care how good the food was. 

The guy taking orders (I'm assuming he was the manager based on age) was great. Always friendly when I'm in there. I got to the payment register and found myself in the middle of a flirting session between the cashier and another worker. Since I disturbed their chat, they were quick to jump back in. Had to butt in again to ask for my drinks -- based on her reaction, I probably should've apologized for asking for what I paid for. My bad. 

Some time later, I noticed an extreme amount of smoke filling the restaurant. A dense haze filled the air and I had to step outside so I could breathe. I noticed a girl monitoring the toaster -- I saw flames inside it and she BLEW into the toaster to put the fire out. Shortly after, a large plume of smoke came out of the toaster. Sweet, found the source (and a health code violation). 

A worker came out and propped the door open with a rock from the side of the curb to get rid of the smoke. He returned to work with the same gloves on that he had picked up the rock and doormat with.

I'll be heading elsewhere for bagels from now on out. Obviously little care is paid to experience and food safety here.

I got the Eliot which was a panini consisting of grilled chicken with mozzarella, roasted red peppers and pesto on sourdough.  Again, very tasty and came with a small side salad.  I'd have felt OK at $7, but not $8.95.  We bought a red velvet cupcake for our daughter and it was fresh and delicious.  Also a tad overpriced at $2.50, but the cupcake shop in Ballantyne charges $2.75 per cupcake for 75% of the size of Two on Earth's.  I'd order a custom red velvet cake from them anytime!!

It looks like this place is far more economical for coffee and breakfast than lunch.  So, we will be back.

I guess you can break my review down to 4.5 for the food taste and quality and 1.5 for the pricing, to get that 3.0 rating.

The locale is artsy, the interior is sparsely decorated with geometrically abnormal tables at weird heights, wood and steel stuff and an exposed wood ceiling. If you're into wood and steel, Cartel has it. They were bumping dubstepLite from the overhead speakers, which was an unexpected change from the guitar + hi high and bass drum + croaking off-key vocals that hipsters seem to love. The dudes at the counter were wearing a sufficient quantity of second-hand clothing to make me certain that they weren't employees of a corporate chain, but that they were actually fulfilling their destinies as bearded Ferrymen helping the uninitiated cross the Single Origin river into the Alterlife. Among other customers there was a distinct lack of true artistic souls, which is disappointing, but really out of the control of Cartel. No one had a typewriter, or was knitting, and only one guy had the messy dreadlocks of someone who hasn't sold out. SOMEthing needs to be done before Cartel gets a reputation of being a scene for sellouts and generics.

Enough about the scene, on to the coffee. I had a black single-origin Chemex from somewhere in the global South, and the wife had the coldbrew. The Chemex is 20 oz., which is cool, but $8~. I guess if you think of it as two coffees it makes sense, but $8~? That's almost 50 cents/ounce. ""Well, you were dumb enough to buy it,"" you might argue. Don't use your laissez-faire logic on me, I expect my independent coffee to be fair trade, not free trade. Still, the flavor was mild and spicy, and the mouthfeel...whatever, it tasted like good coffee. The wife's coldbrew was good, but also a little overpriced. Cream is kept under the tight control of the bearded Ferrymen, probably to keep it fresh, and is served infused with non-verbal judgement over your poor choice of diluting the integrity of your carefully crafted beans. This bit of judgementalism restored my faith a little in Cartel. Maybe they have what it takes to be an elite hipster joint after all. Then on our way out the door I overheard one of the Ferrymen describing to Dreadlocks how one of the blends as ""totally cleanses your system,"" and reassurance washed over me. Cartel isn't just selling coffee after all. It's curing people of their ailments and helping them towards a healthier, less skeptical lifestyle.

Pesto Prima is tucked into a little strip-mall off Roosevelt and Hayden that you probably can't see from the street, right next to my church, hence my excitement for good coffe/sandwhiches on a potentially weekly basis. It is cute and clean inside. Sunday morning the hubby and I shared a scrumptious breakfast croissant that was layered with quality deli-slice ham, perfectly cooked egg, sliced tomato that was so red and tasty, just enough pesto to give it amazing flavor. There may have been cheese, but the rest of it was so flavorful I didn't notice. Got that and a latte for $7. Seriously. The latte rivaled any coffee shop I know ( and I've worked for a couple) and the breakfast croissant put the Einstein brothers to shame. Saturday it was avocado toast.

The only reason that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the location. It's too far from my side of town. I live in the Southwest, and they are located in Boca Park.

I have mainly ordered Nutella latte. I LOVE how they do coffee art. The taste for me is just right. I usually sit in the coffee shop and enjoy my coffee, however my friend and I were in a rush for today's visit. 

Today they were pretty crowded. Most of the people who come here are the ones who like to go on their laptops. First floor gets filled up fast, but they do have a second floor. And there's outside seating a well. Even with the crowd and the noise, I still love the whole vibe of the shop.

The service is good and they have a rewards card you can sign up for if you frequent the place. 

I definitely recommend a visit and am repeat customer!

This is a very nice coffee shop and cafe. Order at the counter and then grab a seat behind it or down the long hallway filled with tables. 

We came at the height of Fringe Madness and was worried there wouldn't be a place to sit. There actually was a table, but it was crammed in between two others and we were four people. You take what you can get though. We were just about to sit when another bigger one opened and we snatched that.

What I'm saying with that is, Killimanjaro has great turn over, even in the mouth of Fringe... so on a normal day, I'm betting you'll be fine. 

The food was excellent. Seriously excellent. We got the Killi Breakfast which for ¬£6 came loaded with toast, eggs, potato scone, bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes and more. All of it tasty and delicious. Woah. We also got the healthy breakfast which was yoghurt, granola and fruit, also tasty, also fresh.  

Staff could use a little more cheer (but again, it was Fringe.) They forgot to bring out two of our meals and our waiter gave a frustrated look at us when we stopped him to ask if it was coming. But ah well.

Besides that, great breakfast, great stop to stop and take a breather in Edinburgh.","review","GAeM4pken2drf7CpuKHuLg",1,1,1,"Kilimanjaro Coffee","Food,Tea Rooms,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",3,3,0,1,6,1,2,4,4,14

Anyway, I ordered a large Pumpkin Latte (with tax it is $4.92) and decided to see if there is WiFi access here.  While sipping my latta that was different but really good, I found Tiffany's network (but it is locked) and some other open networks that I was able to connect to at 65 Mbps (awesome!).  So until I get Internet access at my new place, I now also know where else to go get some web surfing done and some good latte and Korean shaved ice.

And that's why I want to love Bluebird Coffeeshop.  From the bag of beans I spied on the counter, Bluebird appears to be brewing Whole Foods brand coffee.  Is it unique? No.  But it's a perfectly roasted (not raw, not burnt), delicious cup of coffee.  And I love me a fresh, good cup of coffee.  So good job on the coffee, Bluebird.

So why only three stars?  Well, the space is a little odd.  The ceilings are super low, which can create a cozy vibe, but is much more likely to induce claustrophobia.  And the pastries the cafe was offering are wrapped in cellophane.  Yikes.  I head to a coffee shop to avoid 7-Eleven-type products, so any pastry wrapped in air-tight plastic is just depressing and guaranteed to offer a disappointing taste.  

But none of that is why the Bluebird is getting some buzz on the street.  It advertises itself as an Amsterdam-style cafe for folks to relax in while smoking their weed (medically-necessary and doctor-prescribed marijuana, of course).  And, while small, Bluebird does offer several comfy, over-sized chairs for the stoned to slump into and relax.  

When I stopped in to try out the coffee, it was early and the cafe was just opening so the stoners were still asleep.  So I can't speak to the vibe of the cafe when smoke is in the air and folks are having a legal, medically-prescribed mental good time.

So this place has potential and I hope it succeeds.  It would be a welcome addition to downtown Vegas to have a nice cafe.","review","5G0GcGQU7NaPghLBwWeL5w",1,0,2,"Bluebird Coffee Shop","Food,Coffee & Tea",1,9,3,2,12,4,7,11,9,25

(I wanted to [also?] try the goat cheese, beet, egg, etc. savory crepe, but the lady's preference won out... no surprise :P). But it was a damn good crepe. I actually had never had Nutella before, and though I probably won't run to try it again (like I said, I wanted the goat cheese, dammit!), tasting it in almost-Elvis crepe form was a good experience (PB would really have been better).

The coffee, however, was something I'd happily return for. I always appreciate a good cup, especially when I'm told the country of origin of the beans. If you don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, soak up the pour-over (or something even better if you also don't mind a few extra coins). 

Also, I really liked the atmosphere. Bradbury's is a bit off the downtown scene (but that meant it was less crowded, even during the Market hours), and it is a little small and triangular, but it felt (to me) very unpretentious, despite the probably pretentious ingredients offered in some crepes (again, I return to goat che... ""chevre""). But seriously, it was a very chill place to have a java and read about the city. During a weekend trip to Madison, it fit right in.","review","Q0Jt7YL0ZI8J8Wg6W8hRNw",0,0,0,"Bradbury's","Food,Coffee & Tea,Creperies,Restaurants",1,5,1,1,7,0,7,5,3,10

I bought a couple of chocolate iced and vanilla iced donuts -- with sprinkles! -- and the first bites revealed pure yumminess.  The girl behind the counter said that those were the freshest.  They were!  Donuts are under a dollar each, which makes it easy on the budget when you're craving a sugary something or other.

I'm sure the offerings are even better first thing in the morning, when a lot of the donuts are made.

In addition to donuts, one can purchase sandwiches here! (?)  I'll think about trying one of those next time.

Should have started reviews a long time ago, but better late than never huh? 

Pros: 
 -I am deadly afraid of the cold so sitting for a long period at a coffee shop usually isn't an option for me without looking like I am moving each time I visit one.  I would have an extension cord to ensure computer accessibility, a blanket to ensure warmth and headphones to ensure productivity.  Saxby's have the usual music on but it isn't loud to the phone of headphone use.  There are plenty of tables/seats (compared to your usually coffee shops) and I found a plugin without a problem.  

I am currently sitting here in a tank top and shorts! It isn't cold at all here; rather very comfortable. (This is the best part for me!)

The coffee is tasty and my usual three shots of espresso and flavor shot cost less than $2.40 after tax! the flavor shots come in awesome combos like White rabbit (hazelnut and white chocolate) or British Islander (Macadamia nut, white chocolate and toffee nut!) I am totally in love with this place.

Umm..what next...Service is friendly and down to earth. Free internet connection. 

There are conference rooms for rent.  If you wanted to use it, this place charges you $10/hour.  Kind of steep but the flip side is, the whole amount is returned to you in the form of a credit to purchase anything you want. Ultimately, the service is free since you get that money back.  

Karaoke here on Wednesdays 6-8pm as well... all inclusive coffee shop!

-You're gunna wanna chat with the nice folks at Bunna.
-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna.
-Here at Bunna they really know their stuff and you can get toddy at Bunna.
-It takes real coffee expertise at a coffee house to even know what toddy is - go to Bunna and try it.
-Gabi's office hours at Bunna brought me here in a roundabout way.
-Meet with a friend is what I was gunna, he said hey let's meet over at this place I tried with Gabi, do you know it, it's called Bunna.

*Toddy - coffee brewed by soaking the grounds in cold water for 12 hours or so, then draining off the liquid.  The result is highly caffeinated, very smooth, concentrated coffee which can then be used in drinks in place of espresso or consumed on it's own.  It is very smooth because no hot water or steam is used as in regular brewing methods and the bitter acids that are released from the beans by heat are not present in the toddy.","review","P2kVk4cIWyK4e4h14RhK-Q",10,4,8,"Bunna Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,3,0,0,3,0,2,5,3,5

Not so here. We went to the counter, ordered a coffee, two donuts, and a glass of milk, and pulled up to the big, well-worn couch to enjoy. I plopped the kiddo down and stripped off the ten million layers of outergear that one must dress your child in to avoid hypothermia in this city, and the barista/donutmistress brought us our treats. Fantastic. Crispy, hot, tender donuts with sugary topping, a nice drip coffee, and the milk was a hit with the kid. 

We sat there, eating our donuts, drinking our beverages, and giving a last read-through to the books we planned to return to the Mile-End library down the road, and I thought, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Afterward, we looked at the Snakes and Ladders game they had on the table, and studied some of the old maps plastered on other tables. Great atmosphere, great space (enough room for a stroller! hallelujah!), and great fare. They even open early enough to enjoy a treat before the library opens.

It's really difficult to find a compromise between quality and value and for money. Well I recommend The Edinburgh Larder, just off from the Royal Mile.

Now this ""delicatessen, cafe, gallery"" isn't cheap, but I do think it's value for money. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this place is known as a delicatessen, selling quality local produce but ""inspired by the continent"". It's basically got a wide selection of meats and cheeses. Whilst impressive looking, that really isn't for me, but I did appreciate the cafe. First and foremost this place struck me as a great place for vegetarians. It isn't always easy to find veggie options in a sandwich place and when you do its usually boring egg or plain cheese. The Edinburgh Larder though has a great range of creative vegetarian (and vegan) sandwiches. Actually most of the sandwiches are vegetarian. It isn't the cheapest, and expect to pay ¬£4 or ¬£5, but they sure taste nice. They also offer soup, salads, and cakes.

Plus they are not stingy with the fish, which I was half expecting as it was only a fiver which seemed very reasonable. Another reason..... everywhere these days seems to do paninis, not that I have anything against that whatsoever, but it was nice to see something different. Instead of your usual toasted panini, they do toasted wraps, with a selection that sound devine! And I would imagine you can mix it up a little and choose your own.

I was looking for a local coffee shop near my house and was thrilled when I saw that this place was right down the street from me. 

This place is very roomy and is a great place to spend a few hours and get some work done! I always have a hard time finding a place to work when I go to chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean, but I had so many options here! Comfy couches galore!

As for the actual coffee... Delicious! I chose a macadamia nut soy latte and it was so yummy. The pricing isn't bad either. I think it was a little over $4 for a large (and that was with the soy milk up-charge). It was so good that I drank it WAY too fast and kind of spazzed myself out. I couldn't help myself!

You will likely have to wait in some sort of line, depending on when you go. Your patience will be rewarded by your taste buds singing praise for a job well done. Most of their drinks tend to run less sweet (which isn't a bad thing) but they provide a variety of sweetener options to enhance the flavor to your preference.

I recommend picking up coffee beans if you have a grinder, or alternatively, I believe they can grind it for you.

Being from Seattle and loving Starbucks, I'd never tried their coffee before. We were headed to Vegas from San Diego and wanted to stop before getting to the Strip. This location is about 5 miles away from the Strip next to South Point Hotel & Casino. They have a drive through for your convenience and I got the Vanilla Bean Coolata after asking the employee's opinion of what I should get if I like Frappuccino's from Starbucks. Everyone got their coffee and we drove off as we were in a hurry to get to town. The drink was good, if you want no coffee in it. Because I enjoy the taste of vanilla they are getting 2 stars but I kinda wanted some coffee added. Needless to say, the 4 of us seemed overall satisfied with our drinks. On the way out of town we decided to stop there again to avoid the lines of the Strip. This time I made sure to get coffee in my drink and try the Frozen Caramel Coffee Coolata. Gotta pay attention... must have ""coffee"" in the title or you'll get no fix. This time we went in to use the restrooms as well instead of using the drive through. The bathrooms were old and dirty but good enough. The overall wait to get our drinks was at least 10 minutes. It appeared they had a rookie staff working on a Sunday around 4 but fortunately we were their only guests. I couldn't imagine how long it would've taken had there been a line. The 3 employees I saw all seemed flustered and moving frantically to do nothing. Finally we got our drinks and ran for the car to not waste any more time. My girlfriend and I both got the same drink and we both felt like we were drinking straight caramel. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much syrup. Shame on us for not tasting our drinks before driving away.

I went and had an empanada, a small sushi box, and some spaghetti squash.  Oh man, the squash was so smooth.  The workers behind the counters were friendly, and maybe it was complete luck, but the girl scooped exactly .25 lb of the squash into the bowl (I guess including the weight of the bowl) but still, i was fairly impressed.
They also have a ton of great drinks like Saranac cream soda, dr roberts, izze, etc.  It is kinda expensive, but it's good food, so it's worth a splurge now and then.","review","72JWgT9uhOO5QqwsbyCEWA",0,0,0,"Dean & Deluca","Bakeries,Food,Coffee & Tea,Delis,Restaurants",1,6,1,1,8,1,5,6,3,12

We'd actually eaten our Z Pizza slices from next door/room at a table in the Pink Spot's space, mostly because the tables are much bigger and little Claire was elated and engaged with playing some of the board games available therein. (Mind you, her rules for checkers equated to ""I win, Mikey loses"", but I played anyhow, having not seen her in such a long time.)

After our pizza dinner, as we sat there catching up on Yelpiness, SBCness, Bay Area-ness, Lynn and I sipped away at Pumpkin Spice Lattes while Claire enjoyed a scoop of Cotton Candy Ice Cream...

Its a cute place and a sweet-tooth's playland. Just as well, the place is perfectly suited for collegiate or studious crowd with bright lights, comfortable lounge chairs, roomy tables, and open wi-fi.  Plus, if the mountainous availability of sugar and caffeine doesn't do it for you, there's a pizza joint attached next door.

If there were a wicked witch hiding in the back, awaiting an unwitting Hansel and Gretel, I woudn't be surprised; the stock and wares venture in almost every sweet direction, not specializing or capitalizing on any one sugary thing. Before leaving, I picked up a few things for dear Lynn and Claire as well as my gracious hosts back at the apartment.

However, we were extremely disappointed because of the ***VERY*** small sandwiches and the fact we had to go to another place just after eating here to eat lunch again because their portions are more like an appetizer. And, I am 150 lbs and my wife, 120 lbs so we are small people with a normal appetite.

I don't know how places get by with a $ sign on Yelp when this could not be further from the truth. Their sandwiches are more like 1/2 of a typical sandwich and very stingy on the additional items like lettuce and tomato (micro bits and pieces). I told one of the owners we were disappointed and he blamed it on the baguette company not being consistent with their bread sizes. Come on, if the bread comes in too small,  you don't just rip off your customer,  you let them know up front and give a discount or something extra.

This place is so tight and out of touch with reality that they give you just a few tiny pieces of lettuce on the plate which they called a small salad but it wasn't enough for a new born rabbit. Seriously, to see it was to believe it...they had to try hard to tear the lettuce that small. 

So, if you want to spend $16 on one whole sandwich (two of their sandwiches x $8) to get full go ahead. But this place is off the list!! Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but the the prices per portion would make this place easily $$$ restaurant!  And, the people were nice but I'm not in the habit of donating to the success of restaurants without something in return.  No thanks!

And, this is a legitimate review by an engineer and his wife with no ax-to-grind against this establishment or owners. There was another couple that came in with us at the same time. It was their first time too and they left with the same disappointment as us, and we both questioned whether or not the owners may be better at generating false Yelp reviews than they are at running a fair establishment.","review","OerVoYG_MiVyHJV5pvzfpQ",1,1,5,"Baguette Cafe","Food,Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Restaurants",5,5,4,3,4,4,4,5,12,11

I took at least 5 minutes to review the drink options (slushes and smoothies).  There is a list that spans one whole wall of the restaurant behind the counter and TONS of options.  Whatever your fruity craving is, I bet they have that flavor.  

Finally decided on a strawberry/pomegranate slush (I think #61 - how do they memorize all of these?  She knew which it was without looking, lol).  The employee, who was quiet but friendly, asked if I wanted to add Boba.  I'd never tried it before and it was included in the price of the drink so, why not?  

FYI: the charge to pay with a card is 35 cents.  

My drink was ready quickly and I was pleased with the presentation.  If you've never had this experience before (and I'm pretty sure I'm the only one, but I'll describe it just in case), the cup is covered with a film that is attached to the top and you poke a large straw through it to enjoy your beverage.  The straw has to be wide to bring up those boba pearls, which you can clearly see on the bottom of your drink.  Now I don't know what these pearls are comprised of, but they are chewy and jelly-like, although they were pretty tasteless to me.  The girl who made my drink put a really good ratio of boba to slush and I was bringing them up pretty much the entire time. 

Here's my dirty little secret: I don't like the boba.  I didn't enjoy the texture and it didn't have much of a taste to me so I'm going to skip it next time (I know some of you probably just gasped - ""NO BOBA?!?"" - because I've read how much you like it, lol).  I just didn't ""get it"".  But my drink itself was INCREDIBLE.  Perfect amount of sweetness and fruitiness and it seriously hit the spot.  Mine was a non-dairy slush so I'm looking forward to trying many other flavors and some of the smoothie flavors too.  

They serve food, which I'm curious to try, but the drinks are filling so I'm wondering when I'll get the chance to try any of it.  The decor is very simple and almost ""bare"".  The prices are really reasonable for the drinks.  I didn't pay attention to the food prices. 

Can't wait to return and try new flavors but with how good my first one was, I hope I can switch it up!","review","pzmzWFoVIKpuYYG_b9bgJQ",1,0,0,"No1 Boba Tea","Food,Coffee & Tea,Juice Bars & Smoothies",1,21,6,1,16,3,8,18,13,23

It feels like a real cafe: inviting furniture, the robust aroma of coffee beans, the wizzing, hissing, and grinding of various cafe machinery. It's a beautiful thing. Really great place to hang out or take a break from shopping.

I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I've gotten the Nutella Cappuccino twice and the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well. I love the real mugs and the foam art. Plus, both drinks were tasty. Delicious coffee + cool cafe = wonderful experience.

I tried the Fraisier (French cake filled with strawberries and cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re) during my first visit and it was so heavenly! Very delicate cake with delicious cream and strawberries. 

In December, the selection was not as nice. Actually, the quality seemed significantly lower. The ""fresh"" fruit topping the cakes were disgusting. It was obviously old and shouldn't have been in the case nor on sale. The pastries didn't seem to be of the same caliber as Patisserie Manon.

My review is strictly for their drinks -- boba or not. Now, I recently moved from California so their variety of flavors doesn't really do much for me. I've seen it plenty of times. Their regular sizes are about $3.22 and their larges are about $4 (?) I haven't ordered any larges so I'm unfamiliar with the price. 

+1 for them for having egg pudding as one of the choices. I love egg pudding in my milk tea and it was hard for me to find a place that had it as a choice in the Bay Area. It was probably more prominent in SoCal versus NorCal. It tasted like egg pudding too! (Trust me, I've tried egg pudding that wasn't egg pudding.)

Now comes the real deal. I've been to Fresh Cup three times and all three times, my Jasmine Milk Tea tasted different. 

Visit #1: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. My first visit was actually really good. I was surprised that the balance of jasmine tea, milk, and sugar was on point. I could clearly taste that it was jasmine and the milk/sugar combo did not kill the tea taste. Whoever mixed this drink for me has my thumbs up. 

Visit #2: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. Whoever mixed this clearly likes diabetes in a cup. There was NO jasmine tea flavor. The milk and sugar covered up any other flavors in this. It was like drinking water, milk, and sugar mixed in a cup. HORRIBLE. 

Also had a Mango Green Tea with boba. Yup. Definitely diabetes in a cup. The mango syrup killed everything. It was mango syrup water to me. 

Visit #3: Jasmine Milk Tea with less sugar. Nope. No jasmine flavor. No tea flavor. It was just milk with less overpowering sweetness. 


I'm not sure if I wanna go back for a #4 or #5 visit. Honestly, I do like their prices -- it's possibly the lowest in Las Vegas. I mean, tea station charges you almost $5 for a regular but then again ... quality. What I really want to do is find who mixed my drink on my first visit, take down their name, and always go back to them. Granted, I may just find another place instead. 

Oh and they do have a stamp system. However, the workers that work there never pointed that out to me or asked me if I had one. I didn't find out until on my third visit, my best friend took her stamp card out. Three separate visits and no mention of any stamp card. Great job. You could say that I should've read more yelp reviews but I didn't go to Fresh Cup because of yelp. I went because my friends liked the place.","review","EgxV8qTrxd4AH_kphKtagA",1,3,3,"Fresh Cup","Food,Coffee & Tea,Sushi Bars,Restaurants",4,2,1,4,6,2,4,8,8,24

This reminds me of when i was in Seattle and Tully's coffee did the same thing and i returned everyday of my vacation for the same promo deal and of course great coffee. Starbucks, CBTL, etc never offer anything of this sort and certainly not any size. Walking in was a trip but it wasnt as terrible as i expected. When i think tavern i think sad dull bar atmosphere with addicted video poker players, smoking cigarettes, not my cup of tea. But this place is not too shabby, decent decor, a little more lively, certainly a decent patio area to sit outside and the guy behind the counter was pretty upbeat and sociable. My Pumpkin Latte surprised me as it was not too sweet, the perfect drinking temp, and with the promo the perfect cost to end a night of deal hunting.

Well, that time finally came and I stopped in here for a pre-holiday lunch just a few weeks ago.  I have to brag on them, the food is utterly delicious!  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken crepe for lunch, and a First Timer (Nutella with bananas) crepe for dessert.  

(Yes, dessert with lunch.  It was almost Christmas and I was treating myself...  Don't judge!)  

Firstly, let me say that the buffalo chicken crepe was light and airy while the chicken was spicy and savory.  It was complemented by julienned carrots and crumbled blue cheese, which perfected it.  The First Timer dessert crepe was like a warm hazelnut and chocolate banana party wrapped in a pillowy soft crepe; amazingly good.

Second, while it all tasted fabulous, the food *was* a bit on the high price for a lunch entree, especially considering that the crepes don't come with any kind of side so really all you get for your money is a delicious crepe.  Also it was a little bit slow in coming out, but still so yummy that I'll easily forgive the wait.  (Plus, as another reviewer perfectly stated, ""It's not as though they are looking to dethrone McDonald's"" so keep that in mind when you are waiting for your food...  Quality takes time, right?)

I edited this to add that as far as pricing goes a miniature, mixed green salad served as a side with the savory crepes (with a simple lemon and olive oil dressing) would easily make me feel the value for the price had been leveled out and would cost very little to provide.

1. You'll always be able to find one, even if you missed the one half a block earlier.
2. You'll always get the same great tasting coffee, no matter the location.
3. You'll walk out smelling like coffee if your stay is anything beyond getting it to-go.

This particular location is no exception to the rule.  That being said, if you like Starbucks coffee, you'll like it here.  

Living close to this store and visiting semi frequently, I've been able to observe its ups and downs.

Ups: Free WiFi!  Day crew is awesome: they have always taken great care of me and are incredibly polite.  Outdoor seating with spraying water overhead in the summer makes it very pleasant.  Restrooms are generally clean.  Food selection is growing.  Drive thru available!

Downs: I always smell like burnt coffee after sitting in the store for any duration of time. 

To conclude, this is your typical Starbucks coffee shop and does well to keep you buying coffee with their ever so faddy Tall/Grande/Venti paper cups and free WiFi.

The decor was simple, comfortable, open and airy. Its the type of place you can go and be by yourself, or be there by yourself yet not feel alone. During the summer I'm sure the vibe will be different, as currently they have a completely open front space, (like a large garage door opened for you to walk in) however I'm sure I'll be back.

Much better of a hangout joint now with the additional food options, but there is now wifi and power outlets and you can get your parking pass stamped for free/discounted parking.

I had their caramel steamer (no caffeine, hoorah!) and an iced coffee to go. The steamer was light and sweet and perfectly caramelized. Did you know they make their own caramel here? It was perfect.

We went in today (on a Sunday) and got there a couple of minutes before 9:00am, right when it opens. It's a testament to how good this place is because there was already a long line out the door at that point. When the restaurant was open, we ordered, got a table, and were just getting settled in when we were given a small treat (some cereal) while we waited for our food to came out.

For the first time, I ordered the Breakfast Burro with Chorizo. It was really tasty - the Chorizo wasn't overwhelmingly spicy as it sometimes is, but rather complimented the chipotle drizzle, eggs, bacon, and avocado perfectly. Each bite was even more tasty than the previous one. The maple butter crepe with banana br√ªl√©e was also great, as is always is. I would order both again.

My date got the Grand Prix crepe. I tried a bite of it and really liked the coffee crepe, which makes me think that I'd like to try the Pick Me Up next time we go in. He said that it all tasted good and was very filling but probably wouldn't get it again. He liked my Breakfast Burro a lot and also liked the Duck Cuban more, which he has gotten in the past.

Throughout our meal, we noticed that the line was consistently long (pretty much out the door) and it was no different as we were walking out. I'm really glad that regardless of how busy they are, there's a lot of attention to detail put on the plate. The crepes come out spot on.

I'm glad I gave it another chance. I was pretty hungry, so I wanted something hearty. I went for the veggie burger with salsa and guacamole. It was delicious from top to bottom. The bun was fresh and chewy, the lettuce and tomato crisp and colorful, the salsa and guac seemed to have been made fresh on site, and the patty was -- different. But good. Closer to falafel than a traditional soy burger, it had almost a creamy consistency. On paper it sounds gross, but it worked  with the soft bun and toppings. I love condiments, so I also threw on some mustard, which turned out to be an amazing pairing - it was spicy and a little vinegary and added an extra kick to the guacamole and salsa. 

The burger was served with mashed potatoes, and despite coming plain and dry (no garlic, gravy, or otherwise), they were full of flavor.

The place was a bustling on a Sunday afternoon, with everyone from students to townies enjoying tea.  People perched at small tables or sat on the floor in raised seating areas.  The tea list was massive, with teas from various areas of the world and all different types.  Most of the teas were in the $4-5 range and you often seemed to be able to order by the cup or pot.  Small pictures on the menu offered an explanation for how many cups/pots you could expect to get.  For example, the tea I ordered was $4 for a cup (could be steeped 3 times), or $5 for a pot (could be steeped twice).  A cup was more than enough for me, AND, they gave me enough hot water in my personal tea pot that I was able to refill FOUR times.  I'm a wild woman, I tell ya.  

My only issue (and it's really my own) was the bell they give you when you are seated.  You are to use the bell to summon the server when you are ready to order, and later, when you need more hot water.  Mind you, it's  not an obnoxious bell - it's a soft, twinkling sound... but it just felt very strange to be using it, I felt awkward and elitist.      

BOTTOM LINE:  If I could ditch the bell, I'd be sold.  Okay.  I'd go back anyways, who am I kidding.  I thought the place was great.","review","vQlOsQE_cSxAn6cLpjMExg",1,2,5,"Dobr√° Tea","Food,Coffee & Tea",3,4,1,0,1,2,2,3,5,2

this place has great tasting, coffee, isn't starbucks, is independently owned and has the most delicious egg, turkey bacon, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich i've ever tasted (about $5) that came with a nice little side of red grapes. add to that a killer cup of organic, free trade coffee and that's all you really need to say about it.

The ""bar"" is in the back and distinguished by all the liquor bottles.  Easy enough.  But I had heard that they had sandwiches and what not now.  I saw an area that looked like where they made food, but was unsure as if I was supposed to order from them or from the barista.  When I asked if they had a menu, she said, ""We are your menu.""  Um.... ok.  Is that the hipster thing to do now?  I'm a girl who likes options.  I didn't know what my particular craving was that day and I like to know what my choices are.  I also like to know prices.  I ordered my old stand by of a medium vanilla soy latte and the man got a double espresso and it came out to almost $8. That was fine, just a little shocking and had there been prices listed anywhere, I would have known what to expect.

When I stopped drinking espresso three months ago due to poor kidneys, I no longer needed to go to SBUX, as I do not like the other drink choices. I had discovered ""Matcha"" Green Tea Lattes two years ago at SBUX and must say I was intrigued. Intrigued, but not overwhelmed, as it needed work and no melon syrup. Enter CB&TL. I asked for the Green Tea Latte and was given the ""I must have three heads look."" Anyway, after my description, I was given my drink. It's not actually on the menu, however, it's easy enough to make. The charge for a ""Hot Vanilla w/soy"" and substitute the vanilla for the matcha.  Bottom line, after my long winded review, is that it's fairly healthy, delicious, and has naturally occurring caffeine. 
I frequent the three locations on Scottsdale Road, and the staff at all of them are fantastic and accommodating.  
Now, as far as atmosphere, they are all quite unique. 
Scottsdale & Camelback: Down & Dirty. Quick in-n-out drink or light business meeting. Not much in the people watching department.  This may change when Safari Drive  and the W are completed. 
Gainey Village Shops: Best people watching since my days at the Kierland SBUX. Here you get the apres Gainey Village workout crew, as well as the PV crowd. I am usually there in the AM, so it's bubbling with meetings and well dressed local business persons. 
Scottsdale Promenade: This is my pre/post gym shop. It is a very mellow crowd, and you may see a tourist or two. This is the coziest of the three, as they have ample and comfortable outdoor seating. There is usually a quiz for a discount on your beverage. Hint: Have your BlackBerry handy while you're pondering your selection. OK, I'm done.

They add a weird flavor to their bacon so instead of the usual heavenly smoky taste you get this unrecognizable rude awakening with every bite.  Dude, it's bacon: delicious enough as it is - leave it the hell alone! 

I also loved the fruit bowl - every single piece of fruit was ripe and tasty.  Coffee also exceptionally good - then again Bellagio coffee is generally great - so it's not exclusive to this one outlet.  Prices could be lower but when you see their to-go containers you'll understand where your money is going!  It's like they're packing a takeout meal for the White House.   

Their burger was absolutely horrible: completely burned the first time and on the second attempt they forgot half the ingredients I'd requested.  The unburned version didn't taste that much better either!  Their fries are really delicious though. 

The place is too small for the traffic it seems to have, and AC is too high for my liking, but it is SUPER convenient and a great option if you want to grab a quick bite, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Go in with low expectations and save yourself a bank breaking and belly aching trip to the buffet!

We don't eat them any other time, but we always seem to end up here before taking off. I don't know if its because its early and we need the sugar to stay awake on the road, or if its something about doing something out of the ordinary. Either way, this is the place we come to grab a not so healthy pre road trip breakfast. This location is open 24 hours so if you were craving a doughnut at 3am you could come in and get one.

Usually we grab either a half or full dozen of the fresh doughnuts. I like the glazed kind the best, but the cake ones are good as well, just not my personal preference. My favorite flavors are the traditional glazed, twist glazed, lemon filled glazed, and the apple filled crumb covered ones. My husband is a fan of all of the chocolate kinds and usually gets the long johns and custard filled doughnuts. There are a bunch of other flavors if those don't happen to tickle your fancy.

As far as doughnuts go I would say these are pretty good. I like them better than Dunkin Doughnuts and places like Safeway and whatnot. They are pretty cheap, and you can also get a dozen doughnut holes for a buck. I would recommend you stop in and at least try one for yourself.

The only thing I would have to say about this place is the drive through is kind of annoying. It doesn't take very long to get in the store and get out with your goods, but people will still line up around the store for the drive through, which I think takes longer and blocks people from getting out of the parking lot. You are going to be eating a sugar covered dough ball. Just get out of your car and go in the store.","review","2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA",3,5,3,"Bosa Donuts","Food,Donuts,Coffee & Tea",3,14,1,1,10,0,6,11,6,22

The caf√© itself is very quaint and sort of rustic, with well-drawn portraits of Bill Murray on the walls. The staff was really lovely and we'd made a reservation, so we go a nice seat by the window. It is not to far from Stockbridge and it was a was fairly busy so it was good we'd planned ahead.

The breakfast menu isn't too extensive, but everything looked really good, as they offer eggs, bacon and sausage options with toast, they have French toast, salmon and cream cheese with toast or either a meat-filled or full-vegetarian breakfast for ¬£8.90. We opted for the full veggie breakfast and each had a coffee. The coffee was well-made and tasted good, although I think they use a pre-ground coffee or some sort of Italian bean as it wasn't super distinctive in flavour, but that's me being a coffee snob! It was complete fine and warm and tasty.

The breakfast arrived in good time and it was delicious! There was toast, one egg (cooked either scrambled, poached or fried) veggie haggis, two veggie sausages, grilled mushrooms and baked beans. It was a very generous portion and everything was so good, especially the vegetarian haggis. I could have eaten just that! It had walnuts and split peas in it I think and it was absolutely amazing. If anything, they get me as a fan for that. 

It is a worthwhile stop for a well-priced breakfast. I got the pricier option, but most of the breakfast options come in between ¬£5-7. On the weekend they don't serve lunch until one, but they had some tasty looking breakfast-ish type sandwiches that sounds good, so I will definitely have to be back for lunch!","review","MAYbrM_W6bfKuahU5KVr3Q",1,0,1,"The Roamin' Nose","Food,Bistros,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants",0,9,0,0,14,1,9,13,3,31

I really like their stuff. I usually go here for breakfast and can't seem to order anything else but the Huevos Rancheros because it's so good. The portion is easily enough for one person and you possibly could split it. 

Space: 4 stars. I really enjoy the atmosphere. The natural light from the large storefront window fills the entire place. You also can sit facing the window and watch passersby on Liberty Ave., one of the main streets in Downtown. The area towards the back where the bathrooms are looks unfinished. There are about four two-person tables and two larger, higher tables for larger groups. I like that he has plants around the place.

Service: 1 star. The owner is an older gentleman with white hair. His mood is very unpredictable. He can have a pleasant conversation, but most times his social encounters are awkward and rude. He openly admits that you might wait a while for your food since he is the only one who cooks, which is nice to tell people. The food can be worth the worth, but he goes about telling people in odd ways. During the most recent visit a group of 4 people sat down and he told them that they would probably have to wait an hour to get food, but said that they would be better off going to McDonald's or something. He never invited them to stay and have drinks, just dismissed them. It's as if he is miserable for having too many patrons to handle and seems to blame people for even going in, yet if you want to take coffee to go he gets upset with you. You also cannot take anything with you because they don't have containers. I would take your own. I can't figure out what he wants from or for his business or the customers, but he could be more accommodating.","review","3CspzX-2UEUjfLExTjKFvw",0,0,0,"City Cafe","Food,Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Vegetarian,Restaurants",3,10,3,1,10,4,5,12,9,15

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pasta and it was okay. Not bad...at least the pasta itself was cooked appropriately, but it wasn't that flavorful and it was really only saved by the fact that they provided red pepper flakes on the table.

Like any place, there are pros and cons; it all depends on what you're going for.

I enjoy the variety of drinks they have available - teas, smoothies, and the multitude of flavorings, bubbles, and jellies you can mix together to make your own unique creation. 

I get mine light on the ice so I don't have to go boba hunting when I'm finished with my drink.

As someone with a number of food allergies to watch out for, I also appreciate that their drink base is non-dairy, and they also have almond milk available as an option.

The staff are always very friendly, and if you have any special requests (or are very indecisive) they're happy to help you come to a delicious decision. Plus, free wi-fi!

The things that could use improvement? I wish they had more locations around town -- having to drive to the other side of town to get my boba fix makes me sad. I wish Madison could support another bubble tea place or two -- one on each side of town. But that's just a wish on my part; overall, they're centrally located, which is great.

Also, their location is fairly open floor plan -- tall ceilings, and not a lot on the walls. This isn't a problem when it's not busy, but this place is ALWAYS BUSY. (Mostly a good thing!) But busy means noisy, and without anything on the walls or floor to deaden the sound, it really hinders my desire to hang out do a bit of work on their free wifi, and drink my bubble tea!

Overall, I still highly recommend stopping by to at least try it out. And if it's loud in there, I guess you could always ask people to use their inside voices. =)","review","kOMhhbFBBBthwLfup9ZjPg",0,0,0,"Steepery Tea Bar","Food,Bubble Tea,Coffee & Tea,Juice Bars & Smoothies",2,8,0,3,8,1,3,9,5,14

Second- the hours are great, while there may be better frozen treats in the downtown area, this place is more accessible because it is open when you want to go. Second the ice cream is really good - just the classic good stuff that you want on a Friday night or a Monday afternoon (aka anytime of the day). My only bad comment - is that while the ice cream cookie sandwiches are good (good ice cream + tasty cookies), I wish they were made fresh to order. Because they sit in the freezer the cookies get cold and the ice cream becomes air dried. 

All in all - good place to go when you just want a good old fashioned scoop of ice cream.","review","oMDSmhe72hjxoR3EAj6sXQ",0,0,0,"Pink Spot","Food,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",1,10,1,1,9,1,9,4,3,13

And with the lack of cold and wet comes a lack of inviting public (indoor) spaces to sit and talk, sit and read, or sit and work--otherwise known as the local coffee shop.  Which is the part of the reason that I am such a huge cheerleader for Sunrise Coffee and tell everyone that they should drive to Sunrise no matter what side of town they live on.  

Sunrise is one of the only independent coffee shops in Vegas.  And they've done a great job making a caffeinated space to inspire creativity, wakefulness, conversation, and community.  It's a space that's rare in Vegas.  But it's also an inviting space with the options of comfy chairs, tables, outlets to plug in a laptop, and at least one larger table for a group meeting.

Beyond the space, Sunrise offers great coffee (organic, fair trade, and well-roasted), delicious steamed milk coffee drinks (one of the few places in town offering a cafe au lait and Mexican hot chocolate).  And if you want a healthier breakfast option or vegan food options, they've got you covered.  

Bottom line: I'm in love with Sunrise.  It's proof that we can have the sun and outdoors of the desert and not give up the cozy nooks and tasty warm drinks of the colder cities.","review","5G0GcGQU7NaPghLBwWeL5w",8,2,11,"Sunrise Coffee","Food,Tea Rooms,Coffee & Tea,Vegan,Restaurants",3,6,3,2,8,3,4,10,5,19

We heard them talking while waiting for our drinks, with a few sprinkling of curse words here and there. I understand that sometimes people bring their personal agendas to their workplace, but it is never okay to discuss it in front of customers, especially when you're speaking inappropriately. They had no regards for their customers. They spoke like they didn't care how they are representing the company.

There were about four girls working but it took about 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. I've had a much shorter wait time at other boba places with only two, or even one, worker. I don't understand how it took that long to make our drinks with that many workers on the clock.

And another thing.. when our boba was finally ready, we heard one of the girls yell, ""Okay fuck this, I'm getting off!""

Chicken and Waffles: 4/5
Has the chicken tenders as above, but the waffle is awesome! Homemade with powdered sugar on top.

Nutella Crepe: 5/5
Nutella, bananas, chocolate syrup and whip cream. It would be a crime to mess that up.

Sliders: 5/5
Sweet hawaiian rolls, made with a good sized portion of ground beef with their delicious fries! I LOVE their sliders!

Wait staff: 3/5 
This one older lady with an accent is great! Then you have this younger one where I tested her by putting my empty glass at the edge of the table, to where one touch it would fall off the side. And still nothing, she just stood there with a blank stare, ugh! The owner is nice enough, but can work on his people skills. 

Over all the place is great. The wait staff is rocky, but they're still new so i can give them a pass for now. Next time they better have their A game.","review","NXy4P0q3LZACqORUSYNpVg",0,0,0,"The Daily Egg","Food,Coffee & Tea,Mediterranean,Breakfast & Brunch,Restaurants",6,16,3,4,13,5,9,11,12,19

It is often packed on lunch time, which is no surprise since their food is pretty good. You can get anything from soups, sandwiches and salads to pastas and pizzas. Or if you are an early bird you can get a good breafast as well.

However, I had my eyes set on some dessert as I had just had lunch elsewhere.
I wanted to cry from delight as I scanned their dessert menu when I saw that banana split was on the menu. I love it, it's simple but delicious IF done correctly.
N.B. there are some establishments in Edinburgh that include canned fruit in banana split which is just wrong, wrong, wrong...
I am glad to confirm that Caffe Centro knows how to do a banana split properly. My bowl consisted of banana, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce (see picture). That's all that is needed. And it was amazing :)

Next time I might try one of their other desserts as there was plenty of choice.","review","5WbQVsNME0Xr_SQX8JnBxA",1,2,3,"Caffe Centro","Food,Coffee & Tea,Restaurants,Italian",0,9,0,1,11,1,4,5,5,14

Great service by knowledgable employees serving great coffee and expresso. I like the warm feel of wood floors and tables. The pastry case contained a nice selection, including a very tasty quiche. The coffee is roasted locally by Lost Dutchman Coffee, so you can sample new coffees and buy a pound in a very well constructed stay fresh bag. The music is not obtrusive and they have a pool table, suggesting people should socialize rather than bury themselves in electronic devices, but there is WiFi.","review","V80GMVxOodncfnloTVxXyg",0,0,0,"Lost Dutchman Coffee House","Food,Coffee & Tea,Cafes,Restaurants",2,0,0,1,2,4,0,0,3,7

Out of this world!  I could have drank that whole sauce pot and have been content.  It was luscious, smooth and velvety.  Amazing!

They even have really naughty chocolate displays so you could bring the experience home and get a giggle from the recipient.

Service was ok but who cares when the food is sinfully divine.  Definitely a must go when you are in Montreal.  You will not be disappointed.","review","8lxB35fJ4uqiw_6DC5wftQ",0,0,0,"Juliette & Chocolat","Food,Specialty Food,Coffee & Tea,Desserts,Chocolatiers & Shops",1,3,1,0,7,3,0,3,4,8

The new patio is gorgeous! !  I could sit there all day. I complimented the manager and she was so sweet, she talked to me about they changes that were made and she was so nice she made me feel right at home (if home were a cafe in Rome). Seriously though, they use illy coffee, so if you love coffee like I do, you know you can't beat Illy, and the barristas there know their way around the espresso machine. But my favorite is the chocolate croissant, it's so fresh, buttery, and flaky,  and they DON'T skimp on the chocolate, it's THE BEST croissant in town. All the pastries look delicious though. And they have sandwiches too. It's a good place for a quick bite or to sit and relax a while.","review","6QHxCvHu-dimzaFa3EgxhQ",0,0,0,"Palio","Food,Desserts,Coffee & Tea,Nightlife,Coffeeshops",0,4,0,0,8,0,3,7,1,11

I would like to think of myself as a serious foodie, but then again, I haven't had the pleasure of eating donuts on a regular basis since I started this healthy kick....-Clearly these or any donuts wouldn't fit the bill....

We bought 2 dozen, and shared among 4 of us over the course of 2 days, and I must say I loved the variety... Having a variety in donuts as you do in the cupcake-fad world is truly what makes these a treat.... I would like to note that I do have my favorite... Maple Bacon is the best...you know, all things taste better with Bacon, and if you know me, you know I have never ordered a Maple donut... But it tasted like pancakes and bacon... Yum-E!

The Raspberry Lemonade was a treat, and the Banana Split was the hubby's fave.  I know if they had one of these in the East Bay.. It would fit right in...

The only thing is that this place has such tight quarters, and it makes it a challenge when you're trying to get in and out of there...","review","3i4DwliF8ozkwazBQ6KTnQ",0,0,1,"Peace, Love and Little Donuts","Food,Donuts,Coffee & Tea",4,2,2,3,3,2,2,3,5,4

In striking up a conversation with one of the very friendly baristas, I found out why this place is so good; it was started by a barista from one of my favorite cafes in Chicago, and my god it shows. I can't speak to their pizza or pastry, but their espresso is as good as any I've ever had. I regularly make the trip from Champaign where I live just to remember what I'm missing. Come here, order a cortado, and you'll understand what good coffee is.

The four-star rating that exists for this place as of my writing is beyond bizarre. Don't always trust Yelp!","review","q0APeMu7XXmBu6LGnHqM_g",1,0,3,"Flying Machine Coffee","Food,Coffee & Tea",2,7,1,4,11,2,7,11,4,12

Sandwiches, salads, pizza and a few desserts (which I am NOT wild about once tasted, but they are pretty, if you know what I mean).
I am sold on the Italia salad, as well as the Farmers salad, oh, and the Picnic salad. My hubby loves the sandwiches (because for some reason, he won't be caught eating a salad in public). 
They have some good, inexpensive wines, also. I've never tried any of the beers there but it doesn't seem like it would go well with my salad.

My favorites are the soft chicken tacos, roast beef melt, the chicken tortilla soup, and/or any of their omelettes (served all day, get it with their great home potatoes).
