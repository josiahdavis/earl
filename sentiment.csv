"THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service!

I was the 1st person in the store and was greeted immediately.  Justin was the sales person who assisted me and I think he did a great job.  I told him what I was looking for and he helped steer me towards the phone that would be suit my needs.  He also told me one of the phones I was looking for was out of stock and that helped me make my decision since I needed to leave the store with something new.

Once I made my decision he helped me get everything set-up and even charged the phone for me a bit since I told him I'd be travelling.  All in all it was a great experience and I would have no issue returning here for future purchases or help.",4,0,0,0,8,0,3,-1,0.666666666666667,0,2,2,4,2

"My aversion to Verizon Stores probably stem from my experiences years ago with no check-in system and the ""first come first serve/wait forever"" system.  So I am always cautiously optimistic whenever I go into one of them.  

The other day, my droid incredible stopped receiving phone calls.  I had been limping along, hoping to wait for either the iPhone5 or a new droid.  Anyways, I had a family emergency and could not be reached so I finally just broke down and got a new phone to avoid future stress in not being able to be contacted.

I got there around 10:45am and the store had maybe one or two customers in it.  I was up for an upgrade, but didn't harp about the phone not receiving any calls - figured it wasn't worth the trouble to explain and my phone was over 2 years old now.  

Justin really helped me out and having experienced both the iPhone and Android phones, he gave me a lot of good information since I was still on the fence.  I ended up going with the 4S.  I also got a zagg screen protector and an otter box commuter case which Justin applied to my phone.  He transferred all my contacts and also was able to trade in my incredible for some salvage money.  The trade in program must be new, but I did ask him what they did with the phones and after they wipe the memory, the phones are given to countries that cannot afford to buy directly from retailers.  It's good to know the phone will get a second life and not be wasted.

I was in and out of there in 45min and Justin was really knowledgeable, answering all of my questions and really providing great service.

"I felt a little ill after our experience yesterday at the Verizon store. It could have been the questionable food at the Baja Fresh we ate afterward. But, no- it really was the see-sawing of our entire lengthy transaction. 

We were due for the ""new every 2"" deal, but, wouldn't you know it- the prices for the phones we wanted that Hubby had been quoted in an e-mail expired 2 days before! Then we needed to go back out on the floor to look for more affordable models. 

Bonus point for the salesman getting Hubby a gov't employee discount on the phone plan and accessories.

Bonus point for finally having a device in house that will transfer your contacts and photos for you. Minus a point for his lame joke about it costing $10. Minus a point for his inability to transfer my pics when he could transfer Hubby's. 

Minus 2 points for screwing up the rebate process by ringing up the same phone twice, so now the UPC codes on the box and the rebate form don't match. So much for reminding us so often about the glorious $50 rebate per phone, that finally made us choose to go with the original phones we had wanted in the first place. So now I have to squeeze in a trip back to the store sometime very soon before the whole deal expires, or possibly and tragically lose my- wait for it....wait for it.... f-ing ""Verizon Debit Card.""

"I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time. 

First of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again.

Let's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course.

"I'm really surprised that the other reviewers had such a bad time in this store.   

My last carrier was Alltel, and Verizon gobbled them up this year.  Being a cell phone owner since the days when they came in a bag like a heavy small carry-on bag, I have to say I HAVE NEVER HAD A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN A CELL PHONE STORE BEFORE.   EVAH. 

I've had a Treo for many years.  Last year, I dropped the phone and broke the screen.   Went into the Alltel store and they literally said to me, ""sorry you're screwed; we don't replace screens; you have no insurance; you're still under contract"" - so my only solution was to buy a new one for $600 according to the very harried and unpleasant rotund pimply fellow at the Alltel store.   Methinks there must be another way!

So I got on line and found this PDAparts.com for replacement screens.   They warn you: this voids any warranty!!!   But it was ""only"" $70 so I went for it.  They actually have a step-by-step video posted on YouTube on how to replace the screen.  Scary, but my trusty friend/co-worker Chris is an engineer so he did the dirty work for me in about 5 minutes flat.  YAY.    Phone worked perfectly until.... one day... the screen just went blank.

So I'm hosed now right?  And it's December.   The phone technically still WORKED, as in: it rings, and I can fumble to answer it... but I can't see who's calling or who is texting me or make calls... or read my emails... so it was kinda limiting.

So with much trepidation I wandered myself over to the Verizon store on Camelback, figuring I was now only 1 month away from the end of my contract and maybe I just had to bite the bullet and switch to a new phone.    They don't make the Treo 755p anymore, and I really didn't want to learn how to use a whole new phone... too busy.  But I guess I gotta. 

So you walk in and they ask you:  do you need service or sales, and what's your name?    Service... Jane.     They put you on a list which is on a big monitor, and tell you: you are 4th in line for service.   Sigh... look around... and not 5 minutes later, I'm called up. 

The very friendly and CUTE guy who helped me took a look and agreed, the screen is fried.    Do you want to pick out a new phone today, or can you wait a few days to get a refurbished 755p?    Huh?  I could get another 755p?    Yes we will replace your phone but we don't have them HERE so you'd have to wait a few days.   Um... okay... I guess I can wait, but, how much will that cost?   ""Oh, it'll be free.""    FREE?    Sold! 

The people working there were joking around with each other, easy going and super helpful.  There were other people in the store who were clearly stressed and in a bad mood, and from what I observed these folks were super-great at defusing them. 

Something good is going on at that shop and based on my experience (a) I highly recommend them; and (b) I'm sticking with Verizon!",5,0,1,2,39,11,15,7,11,0.282051282051282,1.26045883940621,3,10,26
"First I want to say I love you Bob... I really do.

While hosting a party at the art gallery I got a bit handsy/button pushingsy (no those are not real words but they explain the situation) with my blackberry. I am not technology driven. I wasn't even alcohol driven I have no excuse whatsoever. However, I somehow managed to erase seven months of my child's life in one fell swoop or button push. I immediately wanted to fall into the fetal position and cry a river of tears (or at least a small pool or jacuzzi.) I, the non-stop talker, was speechless. As all the color drained from my face my friend asked what was wrong, and luckily she had her fourteen year old son with her (technology wizards) and he was able to convince me to live until I could get to the Verizon store to have them try to retrieve my photos. This all happened on a Friday night. I was so terrified that they would fail that it took me until Monday to work up the courage to go to the store. I had worked up an ulcer the size of a quarter, and when I went to the store on Camelback and 16th Street at first I was thinking... well I can't write what I was thinking but the store had moved.

The store was located between a mattress store and Baja Fresh. It was small, cramped, and always seemed stressful. I am happy to say it just jumped over to where a video store was located and is in the same general vicinity. Luckily my five year old was wearing her glasses and wanted juice so we spotted it. The new store, now next to Jamba Juice, has a new vibe. It is larger, spacious, and seems more friendly and relaxed. I was seen with very little delay. 

This is where the hero of the story comes in. Bob, Bob, Bob the name rolls off my tongue like a... well, I can't quite think of something that rolls off my tongue but Bob was the man who worked and worked on my phone and got all my pictures back. He saved my life, okay not my life, but the photos of my sweet girl and for that I am very grateful. So if you are in that area and have a Verizon phone you need to deal with, this is the store I would recommend.

"My experience here was.....ok.  The guy at the counter was friendly enough (although not overly talkative).  I had called previously to inquire about upgrading my old blackberry to the new iphone 4.  They had them in stock, and the guy told me he'd set one aside and i could come in and pick it up after work.  I had originally planned to just order one online (I was due for an upgrade), but didn't want to wait for it to arrive by mail....instant gratification was key.  

So i went to the store, but had already researched what type of service and features I wanted to include.  I told the guy that I wanted to add Rhapsody, but asked him if he could explain how it worked first (for those that don't know, it's supposed to be a $10/month music download program - unlimited tunes).  He was quick to state ""oh, that's not available on the iphone""....confused, I asked why it was offered in the package online then.  He was adamant that it was not a feature available to the iphone, until I asked him to research it.....Whaddaya know. It WAS available.  He said nothing and we moved on.  Next, he asked if I wanted insurance.  I said no, but i wanted the extended warranty for $1.99/month.  He stated again ""that's not available with this phone"".  AGAIN, i asked why it was offered online.  He said it probably wouldn't have let me check out with it.....and then clicked a little button, and low and behold...it let him add the extended warranty.  I then informed him that I wanted to reduce my minutes from 900 to 450, since i have not gone over the 450 in over 6 months....He looked at my account and said that i should absolutely stay with the 900 minutes because I would definitely go over.  Mind you, I had just checked my account earlier in the day, so I knew where I stood.  He told me that I was already at 380 minutes, and I would have to pay extra for any minutes I went over.  I looked at him for a minute....then told him that since my cycle restarted tomorrow,...I was clearly still going to be ok.  He said nothing and kept going.  He then asked me if I wanted to look at cases and I said no because I had already found a specialty one online that I planned to order.  He stated that I should definitely look at their selection first, because they had a ton to choose from and could probably get me discount.  So I said ok and he walked me over to their turnstile....with a total of 8 choices (and three of them were variations of black).  When I asked what the discount was, he said he could get me a discount....if i bought a package that included about 5 other things that i didnt even need or want.....

Overall, he was nice and I got the phone and plan i wanted....but only because I had researched it myself.  Don't expect them to know what they're talking about, and go prepared!",3,3,4,4,25,10,6,14,10,0.4,0.416666666666667,0,8,17

"My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan. We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.

Here's what happened:
Unbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. 

Me -So how do I change my name on my account?  

Sale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?

Me - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.
So how do I go about changing my name on my account?

Sales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.

Me - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?

Sales associate - Not at the store level

Me- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....

I then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.

The woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?

"I have been with Verizon for many years now. I am on the family plan.
I have my Brother ,his wife ,all their kids on my plan.
So yes my bill is high.
I have used the same cell phone for 3 years now and it still works just fine and really well.
It is the kids that like to destroy their phones. Anyone with kids you know this.
So I had changed my plan 2 years ago to get better coverage. All the kids do is text.
I do not know if they even really talk anymore!
The texting these days is unlimted which really saves me a lot of $$.
The new phones always go to the kids. Yes, that is what I said.
Hey what can you do???
This store has always been very helpful in getting new phones, fixing my plan and updating everything I do.
It is very busy in there all the time though. Sometimes more busy than others.
I like it that I can pay my bill on  line though. 
I always see people in there paying their bill.  Ugghh, that would be such a pain for me.

"Okay, so I ended up having to replace my phone because I dropped it in a sink of water when I was house sitting. In December. Lost all my photos and music. It was a sad day. Fast forward two months, and it's barely keeping a charge and doing goofy things. Like calling my ex. Eek! I was still a month away from renewing my contract and desperate. As it turned out, I could change my contact, get a new phone that was priced into my monthly fee, and lose my unlimited data, all in one step. Who could resist? Oh, Verizon. 

After arriving shortly after they opened, I waited for an associate while checking out their selection of toys. I mean phones. Found an awesome Motorola that is smaller than my old one and it is red. Devilish. By the time Juan approached me to assist, I had my heart set on that phone. Juan was great at processing the sale and setting up my new purchase. The whole ordeal took about an hour, which seems long but he was very thorough. So, not entirely bad. By the time I left, I was happy. And Juan downloaded an app that got me a free smoothie from Jamba Juice. Score! The one entertaining aspect of this experience was witnessing all the angry white people. Silly crackers.

Oh, Verizon. Keep it classy.",4,1,3,2,26,-2,3,1,0.666666666666667,-0.0769230769230769,0.553846153846154,8,6,12
"I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone.
I went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone. My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away.
My wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. 
One female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.
Of course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.
I told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.
I've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.
Of course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.
The customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.
If I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.
If Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.
If I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.

While the guy that was helping me change phones over worked on the computer he started up a conversation with the employee next to him about the party they were going to after work, all about video games and drinking. Seriously? I thought to myself. He had very little knowledge of what they even sold in the store. ""Do you sell the FitBit bands?"" Umm I'm not sure, then he walks across the store to ask someone else if they did. She took two steps to her right and pointed to the huge stack on display, clearly he must have been blind.  Then I ask ""Do you have the arm bands that will fit my phone? like for running"" He again hesitates and asks someone else if they know the answer.

"I was toying with the idea of upgrading my iPhone and in the process switching from AT&T to Verizon so that I could bundle the new phone with my iPad. A coworker went to this Verizon store over the weekend and was telling me that she got all these great deals and discounts, along with them buying back her current device and then giving another discount for bundling her iphone with a tablet, etc.  
I went in 2 days later hoping for the same great deal only to be totally confused by the associates explanation of what my options were, deceived about the difference in the pricing options, not being able to bundle iPhone with iPad for some reason, no discounts/credits, nothing. Not even any incentive to come over from AT&T. Would end up costing me a lot more than what I'm paying for with AT&T. Also their service was slow and they weren't very customer service focused.

It helped being there on a weekday evening, for the weekends are packed.

"I just 'droided myself and I'm not ashamed to admit it:)

I got my first cellular telephone in 1985...it took the better part of a day to install in my car, had a total weight of nearly 30 lb's and had to be bought as a separate item and then matched to the cellular provider (in this case McCaw Communications, the predecessor of CellularOne and ATT).

It cost more than $1,000 and that cost was surprisingly low compared to the Motorola ""banana"" phone I got a year later (a ""pocket phone"" if you had pockets that could accommodate a 3 lb., 12"" x 5"" phone:)

It was wonderful...I could talk and do business whether I was in my car, on my boat, out skiing or playing golf, in another city (all I had to do was pack my charger and spare battery...another 10 -12 pounds:)

I stayed with ATT until 2007 when my patience with poor signal and poor service finally ran out...that's right 22 years of patience...I'm like a camel of patience, apparently:)

I switched to Verizon and have never looked back:)

The first set of phones were state of the art a couple of years ago and the Beautiful Carin and I were very happy with them (in fact, my girl is now the queen...or maybe the crown princess...of texting...so fast! :)

Coverage was and is excellent (3G everywhere:)

It was time for my ""new every 2"" upgrade from Verizon, and I 'droided myself and Carin...no I didn't get any on anyone else:)

My kids all have iPhone's (and they think they are so much cooler than the old man), but I may have the last laugh...25,000 'droid apps and growning (all but a couple of dozen are free:)...much better coverage than ATT, access to all that crazy google stuff (even Doc's,  Voice and Wave work on the 'droid:)

Constant updates (I just got a text that Verizon will update the eris 'droid to android 2.0 in January:), and knowledgeable, organized and pleasant people whenever I go into one of their stores for accessories and what have you:)

"I've been a customer for over 5 years and feel Verizon has a long way to go when it comes to customer service. I hate to give anyone a bad review but after the problems I've had at that store and the amount of time I had to spend to correct them, I have to pass it along.
Had a Blackberry that was replaced 4 times in 6 months. RIM told me the design was problematic and they were telling people to get a replacement with a newer model. Not naming names but I had one girl tell me my phone wasn't broken and to ""come back when it's really broken"" then another gave me completely incorrect information and that's just on 2 of 46 visits I made regarding that phone.
I finally had to file a complaint with the FCC for fraud because I was paying for service on a phone that didn't work. It was then that I was contacted by a corporate rep. They have an entirely different attitude and capability working with people. In the store I have been treated so poorly that I refuse to step foot in there ever again. I have found the same problem at other stores. No one seems to know how to work with the public or how to actually resolve a problem for a customer.
It's too bad these employees aren't properly trained or perhaps don't care and because of that I will not renew my Verizon contract when it's up.

I pleaded with them to be able to change to a different brand, but was told that couldn't happen.

"So unhappy with my experience at this store. LOVE my new GS5 and my coverage has been perfect, but I would recommend avoiding this store.  The day we went to shop we spent at least 45 minutes waiting- not a big deal. They were busy, I get it.  When we finally saw a rep he was very sales-y and kind of pushy. I just told you I'm here for a new plan and phone.... you don't have to sell me. 

Anyway, he tells us about a current regional promotion where we would receive a free 1gb of data for the entire contract length as long as we ported in a local number. Perfect, I wanted to anyway.  After another hour of him fumbling to get the phones set up and numbers ported in we were finally on our way.  

The next day we notice on our phones that our plan says we only have 1gb of data. We call Verizon and they explain that the promotion doesn't start until the second month. Again, not that big of a deal, but pretty annoying that he didn't find that necessary to tell us.

Well, a couple of days ago our second month starts and what do you know, we still only have 1gb!  After speaking with Verizon on the phone they told us the promotion actually started 5 days after we started our plan and the employee just told us about it early. They assured us it shouldn't be a problem, just to go to the store and have it sorted it.

Once at the store my boyfriend received terrible customer service.  He spoke with the manager and she was completely inflexible and unapologetic. I'm sorry, but if your employee is giving the wrong information you need to do the right thing and honor it.

I spoke with Verizon's corp center in which a supervisor had given me the address for this location and told me I was within my 14 days to return everything and cancel my contract.  I was told by 2 people at Verizon I was able to cancel my contract and i just needed to drive down and have them take it for me.  However when I got down there the company lied to me and told me that these two people put in the notes that they specifically told me i COULDN'T return the phone.

Weird because when i called Verizon's corp center after leaving the store, they told me the notes actually indicated i was within my 14 days and i could return the phone.  They also informed me it reads specifically on Verizon's website in their customer agreement that i could cancel and return everything 14 days from ACTIVATION for full refund.

However when i took my evidence down to the store they STILL refused to take it back.  So I told them to simply cancel the service, I'll sell the phone on ebay.  Well AJ is her name, and she ""cancelled"" my service alright.  I made her give me a receipt and had a witness drive down. AJ didn't really cancel anything, she put a FUTURE cancel date that way it would be outside of my 14 day window and I'd be forced to pay the term fees!!!  Not only that but the moment she approached me she started talking nasty to me about kicking me out of the store if I speak to her the way i spoke with someone on my PERSONAL phone conversation.  It's none of her business what i say to someone on a personal call, i could have found out my husband was cheating for all she knew.

The so called manager mr McDonald was also RUDE towards me and still refused to let me return the phone even though company rules said i could.  I hope Verizon realizes the sort of people that are running their stores.

I have to admit, there were 2 kind employees there out of the 5 I talked with. They seemed to think what was happening with me wasn't fair and they tried to secretly help me, but it's weird they were trying to do it behind their boss' back, like helping customers were against company policy. Some store manager that would fear his employees into treating customers like crap.

I would say NEVER go to this store location and never go to Verizon period. Find any company on the planet but they don't deserve your money.  And if you must go to  Verizon, take your dollars and the commission to another store location, but this one does NOT deserve anything from anyone.  If anything they deserve an under cover agent from Verizon investigating the way they treat people.  Because I have friends with verizon and I've gone with them into Verizon stores, NEVER in my life have i been treated so poorly.",1,1,0,4,25,-8,-10,5,-4.33333333333333,-0.32,0.81,10,3,12
"If I can avoid going into a Verizon store, I will, but the iPhone 4s was being released on October 14, and I couldn't wait. I called the Scottsdale Promenade store at 8:05 am and they didn't even answer the phone, so I called the Desert Ridge location. They picked up on the second ring. They assured me if I came in the morning, I would get a phone, but they couldn't promise one in the afternoon.  Since I was driving down towards Scottsdale to get on the 101, I drove by the Promenade. The line was at least 40 deep outside the store, so I headed over to Desert Ridge -- one person in line! They had employees outside handing out info sheets and forms to get you started. They were so upbeat and friendly. Really, was I at a Verizon store?

When I got inside (they were letting in small groups at a time as people were leaving), they had another employee directing us to the new phone test area, where we could ask additional questions before being turned over to the sales rep. (And I had a lot of questions, since this is my first iPhone).

Billy, my sales rep, was efficient and really patient with me. It was a pretty easy and quick process until we realized the keyboard on the phone didn't work. There was a process he had to go through to undo all the work he had done and then get me another phone. I am grateful I tried to use everything before I left the store. It just made my visit a little longer, but when I left, I felt confident that I could at least do the basics on my new phone.

So happy with my new phone . . . total shock and awe with such a wonderful experience at the Verizon store. This will be my store of choice from now on!",4,1,1,1,19,11,14,12,12.3333333333333,0.578947368421053,1.03508771929825,2,9,8

always have the dreaded wait!  Not so bad at all... about 15 minutes...perfect in book!  Enter ERIC ANGULO one of zee best Retail Business Associates I have worked with in ages.

With I must add again great patience and politeness.

"Verizon stores and their system of herding their customers must have been designed by some Machiavellian-type person who watches from afar, with hidden cameras placed in all locations, and watches what transpires inside the stores like some sort of ""Big Brother"" experiment in human behavior.

When I walk into a Verizon Wireless store because my unfortunately-named Verizon Glyde (all I can think of is a personal lubricant, how about you? maybe I have a dirty mind...) with a touch screen no longer wants to be touched... the ""greeter"" scowls at me, tells me it's gonna be at least an hour and a half, and then adds my name to the bottom of the queue.  

I instantly notice that it smells of excrement... and that, quite literally, the store is crawling with humans.  It's like a bus station.  There are sad-looking people on benches, huddled together for moral support, crying in the corner, and laying in a puddle on the floor.  I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.

I have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.  I bore witness to two different women using Verizon phones, calling customer service in tears, bawling about how the reps at the store refused to help them. I should have taken this as a sign. I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue. I mean, there was almost a brawl. I saw three crickets, a spider and a roach... and this was all before my name was called.

The service rep could not, no, WOULD not, fix my phone.  He took one look at the Glyde and started to laugh. ""THIS is the worst phone Verizon ever produced.  I can't fix this thing.  I won't even be trying.  Sorry, girl.  You need to get yourself another phone.""  Rep then proceeded to detail my options. A. Buy brand-new expensive phone. B. Buy pre-owned expensive phone. C. Be phoneless.  ""Surely you must have a clunky Zack Morris-style phone to donate to a damsel in distress!"" I protested.  No dice.  ""Not even a loaner until my next paycheck?"" Not a snowball's chance in hell.  

It's ever so obvious that I was never going to get my phone fixed, and no matter what was wrong with it, I was going to be told that I had no choice but to purchase an entire new phone.  I think it's more than a little messed-up to not offer your customers solutions and options instead of backing them into corners.

This place is terrible. i wish that yelp had a negative star chart or perhaps a rating by number of black holes possible because that is exactly where you will find yourself if you ever make the sad mistake of darkening this establishments doorway. 

i needed a new phone. I did my homework. i knew exactly what i wanted. (HTC DNA) 
what should have been an in and out purchase turned into a ninety (90) minute debacle of a pushy  sales rep trying to up-sell me on every single piece of nick-knacky trash in the store. screen covers i did not want  car chargers i did not need, and  a radio controlled helicopter. No lie. i kid you not. i came in just for a phone and the guy tried to up-sell me on a radio controlled helicopter. 

another 45 minutes to an hour the rep spent trying to up-sell me on a data/minute plan i did not want/need. Stating that if i bought more items in store and raised the amount of purchase when i extended my contract  he could give me a break on my bill. at this point i told him thanks but no thanks ill buy online and prepared to leave when magically he was able to get my bill fixed and my phone activated in about 5 minutes. nearly ninety minutes later i walk out with my new phone.

***********additional note 

i did buy a shatter proof case to protect my investment. (another up-sell item) based on the reps pitch of it being ""protective and  shock resistant and able withstand drop damage."" 

today my phone fell from the waist band of my scrubs and hit the sidewalk STILL INSIDE THE ""PROTECTIVE"" CASE and shattered. when i took it in for help was told that an insurance claim was my only option. i asked for a manager to discuss at least a refund on the faulty case i was told that there was nothing wrong with it. i explained that the ""protective"" case wasn't that protective and that it was sold as something it clearly wasn't. ...no dice.

my next phone, i will buy online. as every other piece of equipment or accessory i need. Verizon is a good company and their phone and online support is top of the line.

"I think Verizon is a great store overall, but walking into this store and trying to get help is exceedingly painful. 
I'm here on a Sunday afternoon between church services, and with me are my wife and her younger siblings, who we have for the day.
My phone doesn't charge, that's why I'm here.  I describe the problem to the assistant that is supposed to help me, and we start talking, but after asking my name and looking up my account, he looks at me and says, 'you aren't an account manager, so I can't help you.'  Period. No more troubleshooting, that's the end of the conversation. 
I Co-own a business, and my business partner is the one that created the Verizon account, so his is the only name on it.  If I need to operate anything or change my plan, I just sign in under that username and password. 
SO. I go about trying to log on using my wife's phone (as mine is out of commission), thinking its going to be a simple process to add myself on as an account manager.  I get back in the queue, and shortly later another representative walks over and starts the process to help, I tell him my phone won't charge, and that I know they cant warranty it out unless an account manager is here. He immediately tells me that if I'm not on the account, he can't do anything for me. I told this guy, 'yes, but I'm adding myself to the account now, so that wont be a problem.'  He was shocked that i would suggest such a thing, and got this tone in his voice that one would use with an unruly child, and told me that its not ok to do that, they cant help me out, and i need to bring in the account manager, because what I'm doing isn't legal.
At that point, tired of being ridiculed, and obviously not getting the help i needed, i decided to take my family and go home!

Verizon 611 was able to troubleshoot the telephone remotely.  I contacted them after I walked out the store after speaking to a rep.  I am now getting a second warranty telephone in 2 weeks, which questions their whole stock of warranty phones at Verizon,  The first Warranty phone lasted only one day.  Would have been better to keep my original telephone and lived with the speakerphone failure. 

Furthermore, I find it troubling that they do not listen to my request about a possible request, and they further went and tried to ""upsize"" me on the plan and telephone.  I denied.  

This whole thing about smartphones hardware and software is troubling.  If it were not for my contract, I would have dumped Verizon in a heartbeat, and I did tell this to Verizon 611.

1) Original telephone lasted 1 year before having issues
2) First Warranty telephone lasted 1 day before having issues
3) Second Warranty telephone...to be determined.  I am expecting its arrival at my doorstep.

Common Quality Assurance and Statistical Analysis regarding failures would question the whole stock of Warranty phones they have.

"Okay, I call Verizon 800# to check out WHERE the closest store was when I was out and about. I was directed to this store. So here, I go.

I drive all the way back out and THEN, return everything, cancel my contract, my ph #, etc... -it's been less than 3 days; and want a credit. Not to mention the time I wasted...Thinking I had it all figured out, it's canceled, right? I go to A REAL Verizon store and asked get a new ph- only to find out Go Wireless NEVER canceled my old number/contract. WTF?!! Geezus, and am told I need to call the Go Wireless Store to have them cancel it... I call the Store again..and they give me the 800 # for Verizon. Lucky, I called because Verizon was going to charge me the $350 for early term fee-- THAT Go Wireless never took care of in the first place.... Geezus guys!

"Worst. Experience. Ever.

I went in to buy a new phone. They told me they didn't have it there and would have to order it. I wasn't too happy about this but they  told me it would be ""like 2 to 4 days.""  I ordered a phone on December 1st and, after tons of phone calls that *I* made (they never bothered to check in or call me), it finally came in on the 21st.

While I understand this was in part due to the phones being on back order (how can you not know that if you work at a phone store??), it was still a huge hassle for me and they didn't and WOULDN'T give me anything for my ordeal. They could have thrown in some screen protectors or something and I would have been satisfied. But the girl didn't offer, and when I asked it was just ""sorry."" I was also told they could get me a better deal on my plan. Did they? Nope. She didn't even try. 

I hope to God I never have to deal with these people ever again, and I will tell anyone I meet never to go there. Ridiculous.",1,0,0,0,16,-1,4,6,3,-0.0625,0.729166666666667,5,3,8

"This place is terrible for many reasons.  I ordered my iPhone 6 from here thinking I could avoid a line at the actual Verizon store.  Be warned, this not actually Verizon and they do not know their stuff like real Verizon employees do.  I needed to change my plan and they suggested the Edge plan.  They explained most of it right except for the part about the cost of the phone, which was a huge deal.  It still ended up being cheaper for me, but they absolutely butchered how this deal worked, even after I confirmed the cost of the phone with 2 employees, one who appeared to be some sort of manager.  I ordered my phone and was told I would be notified when it arrived.  My fiancé ordered his phone after I did from the Verizon website, and his arrived in 3 days.  My phone however took 3 and a half weeks to arrive, and each time I called to check I was told there was absolutely NO WAY to track their shipments.  This is very shady, real Verizon stores provide tracking numbers.  To make matters even worse, I never got a notification that my phone had arrived, nor did the main account holder.  It took me actually going into the store and asking if my phone was in, who knows how long it had been there!  (Also, when I had called 5 minutes prior to stopping by the store their phone system was down.  Go figure, it's a phone store.)  When I explained to them that I was unhappy with how the Edge plan was explained to me incorrectly, and how long it took my phone to arrive, they offered to give me a discount on accessories for my phone.

I was so unimpressed he didn't take the time to understand my needs and match me up to the right phone.

"About two weeks ago we stopped in to check things out. We had not had a contract for well over a year and they were always trying to get us to reup. 

You walk in and have to sign in and wait. It is amazing to me that so many folks want phones what seems to be 24 hours a day, these places are always busy. 

Our turn comes up and Santiago is the young man who got us. We talked about a few Blackberries and he was calm and helpful with explanations on the two we were considering. So I decided on the Storm and Gus got an LG Chocolate with our plan these are free after the rebate. Santiago showed a few cases and other items available of which Gus got a case. He presented these items without being pushy about it. 

So during the time I have had my phone I have encountered a few oddities. I would email Santiago and he would get back to me in a decent time frame. I could not get the phone to do a few things and the instructions did not help, his did. Yet still the phone was not doing as expected, but I figured it was me and not the phone since I am not the brightest bulb when it comes to such things. 

After exploring my phone I got the feeling it was a reconditioned phone and mentioned this to Santiago and he assured me they do not give out such items. But he did tell me to bring it in if there is a problem and they will exchange it. I thanked him for the nice offer but said I will continue to play with it and see if it is indeed the phone or me.

"I dont know who to be mad at. Seems there was an update that was forced upon the RAZR MAXX phones to upgrade to the newest version of android. Problem is i keep getting packet errors every time the download finishes and all the phone wants to do is error the crap outta everything i do forcing a soft reset where it'll restore itself to a previous state, how it determined this state to revert to i have no idea.

Read on the forums to preform a hard reset and restore all settings to factory default. Seems easy enough except i have tried both methods back to back after one another and instead of factory settings it still reverts back to that state. 

I dont have the time now due to work or else i'd just hop on XDA and root the phone and flash a new upgraded ROM. 

So on the way to Total Wine I noticed a Verizon store in Boca Park. Drove in and infromed them of my situation. I was assigned to Aileen Endowai. I explained to her what was going on and while i was waiting individually uninstalled every single installed app on my phone then did a hard reset in front of her just to have it boot up not factory reset and still all the apps installed. 

Aileen explained the situation and how the update has been screwing with everyone's phones and the only option is to ship me a replacement like-new condition phone. 

She also answered any and all questions i had regarding my account and offered to show me accessories that were on clearance due to my phone being outdated.

Overall this is one of the more positive customer relations issues i've ever had the experience of being involved in. Ideally i would have liked to have my current phone fixed right then and there and that there was something i was doing wrong preventing the update from coming through then walking out with some accessories for their troubles but in the end it all worked out fine.

Here's the kicker, when I went to Verizon to ask how to transfer my pictures to my computer..they were (why was I surprised) unhelpful.  

In the end, the T-Mobile representative took my Verizon phone, adjusted the setting and told me how to handle the transfer.

"Went into the store today to ""simply"" change billing information on my account.  The customer service rep that was assigned to help me turned into a ""lack of"" customer service person.  Guess that most things at a corporate level are just not simple or tend to lead to ""lack of"" customer service.

I then went to my car, called customer service on my phone, and had everything completed in less than 5 minutes.

Pride of ownership is just not going to be found, in many cases, at the corporate level.  Is it due to lack of pay, benefits, etc????? i have no idea, but it sure does make me feel very very small in a large sterile verizon world.

"Oh yes, here we go.

For six years I was with Verizon Wireless. I made the switch to their service in Reno, NV when I was still in college. I never had a problem with them. Their service is top-notch. I have always run into very helpful sales people.

For the past two years, after extending my contract, I have had automatic bill payment set up for my cell phone. I did this so I would never, ever miss a payment. NEVER. So, since I have auto-pay it is impossible for me to miss a payment, correct? Well, not according to Verizon Wireless.

Just last month I started doing some shopping around for a new phone, and yes, a new provider. I wanted to explore my options. After doing many calculations on plans and phone types I decided to switch to T-Mobile. It was in the middle of the month so I knew I would have to pay my final bill with Verizon and I had no problem with that.

So, I went directly to the store to pay the bill. I thought all was good to go. THEN I get a PAPER BILL in the mail from them. Hmm, thought I, this is strange, I have not gotten a paper bill in the mail for two years. How odd. I decided I better go down to the store and see what was up. I explained my situation to the customer service dude and all seemed okay at first. Then he realized I was not trying to find out my pro-rate because I had come to Verizon from another carrier, but because I had switched to another provider from Verizon. Welp, all of the sudden I was a second class citizen because he straight up tells me, ""Well just because you switched carriers doesn't mean you can't pay your bill."" AHEM AHEM AHEM! WHAT??!?! I never did NOT pay my bill! 

This big douche stick then proceeds to tell me I must pay my final bill - in full. Something which I did not think was correct or right, but because I just wanted to leave and be done with it - I paid. I asked him, ""This is it, right? No more. I won't hear from you guys again?"" and he said yes.

Well, well, well..... two days pass and I get ANOTHER paper statement from Verizon, this time in very rude CAPS-LOCK letters telling me I have an OVER-DUE BILL and just because I switched carriers does not mean I am not allowed to not pay my bill.

Oh I could have thrown a brick through every Verizon Wireless store in the Las Vegas valley at this point. I called Verizon's Customer Service line and gently, but somewhat heatedly explained my situation and said I just really wanted to make sure I was totally square with the account, that nothing was left. The girl on the line brought up my account and said the balance due was ""zero"". I asked her why I had started getting paper statements when I never, ever got paper statements before. So she clickity-clacks on her computer and then has the audacity to say to me, ""Well you did not make a payment in May."" LIKE HELL I DIDN'T MAKE A PAYMENT IN MAY! At this point my head was exploding, and I'm not going to lie - I went off on her. Everything from, why did you send me paper statements, and I've always had auto-pay, and this seems very convenient that your company is trying to screw me when, strangely enough, I have switched to T-Mobile!!

Arrrrrrrgh! I am very careful about my credit score and my payments and to know that Verizon blatantly tried to screw me just because I switched providers is SO ANNOYING! Well, beware of Verizon Wireless is all I can say. If you switch from them you better be very careful how you handle getting everything paid off because apparently they have issues with treating long-time customers nicely when they make a decision to switch to a different service.",1,0,3,3,41,2,-10,16,2.66666666666667,0.0487804878048781,0.597560975609756,8,10,23

I walked in, a guy immediately came to my assistance, look at my phone, and fixed in like 15 seconds. It was awesome. Apparently with the new software update the phone added this extra keyboard app that messed with the system. So he got rid of it and tada, I can text again!

"They actually helped me with a major issue on my account. Unfortunately, six months later, I canceled my service.

My GF and I were having issues with our phones so we decided to come into this store. Ryan, who is apparently a poor excuse for a manager, greeted us and I explained the issue I was having with my phone. Basically, the headset jack on the phone was faulty and simultaneously would give me alerts saying I'm plugging and unplugging my headset. Ryan was SO persistent that there was a software issue and asked if I had updated the software. It was already up to date and again he persisted that maybe something was in the hole of the jack. Believe me, before wasting time on my Vegas trip, I tried everything.. resetting, blowing air into the port, etc, to insure that there's no debris . Seems like he's more concerned about store profit than helping customers, who in fact, are in need of help. With that being said, I feel he needs customer service classes that he needs to enroll in. 

Verizon sales associate, Sarai, was more than helpful. She is the reason why I want to give FIVE stars for excellent customer service!

Extremely friendly and patient with our needs. She took her time to help us out with both our phones when we were having some issues. She also explained some of the offers that would benefit us without having that ""salesman"" attitude. With that being said, if everyone had Sarai's attitude and personality, many more people would probably feel more at ease browsing around the store without feeling the pressure.

"Really bad experience here and with Verizon Stores in LV in general in the past.  11/11/14 I went in here looking to buy a prepaid phone since i spend half the year out of the country and transfer my service from my old android phone i had activated the day before that wouldn't work with certain apps.   Should be super simple, right?  Read on...

First,  I was told (incorrectly)  by the sales agent that I couldn't do that and would have to pay for the existing phone line and the new phone line for a month.   He tried to immediately sell me on the first phone I asked about and tried to make me think it would be a good deal even paying for both plans...that's right, pay for two phone plans at the same time....and there was no way around this since i activated already with my old phone.

When I asked the sales agent why I would be required to pay for two plans he became defensive and gave me a line that ""I understand what you're saying but there's nothing I can do...""

I was bewildered.  Surely that can't be the case????  It's that difficult to port a phone number to a new phone???  I calmly asked to talk to the manager and he's like that's right.  He gave me a load of BS that customer service on the phone is different than their store, they have different systems and on and on.  

You cannot be serious?

Both the phone support and the store have the Verizon name, and you don't work to do what is in the best interest of your customer?  

The worst part is when I immediately called customer service from their store in complete disbelief of what I was just told, they informed me that it is in fact VERY EASY to port your number over to a new prepaid phone.  Customer service over the phone was very good/friendly.

Finally the manager admitted that I could buy a prepaid phone across the street at Best Buy AFTER I got off the line with customer service.  They simply wouldn't sell me a prepaid phone there without activating it.  This is clearly because they care MORE ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS than they do doing the right thing in the first place (which will help them keep customers and grow their business....idiots!)

What an outright fraud that they tried to get me to double pay for a plan with them.  Even if it is for a month.  Clearly this is fraud or just plain incompetence.

"Went here to get a replacement phone and Mitch helped me. I don't understand the hype that several reviewers posted about him - he wasn't rude or anything, but he definitely seemed like he didn't want to be there. I also had a long wait because I guess he was having issues with my account. 

On my original plan, I had a promotion where I received 6gb of data for $30 but when Mitch was activating my new phone (under the same contract/plan), he said he would not be able to transfer over the previous data plan. No idea why, but I will get back to this later. I just accepted that I wouldn't have the data plan, regardless of the fact that the contract was still the same (I paid retail price for the phone because I didn't want to start a new contract). 

After I got home and looked over my contract online, I saw that not only did I not have the 6gb data plan as Mitch mentioned, I also noticed that there was a new monthly charge for $5. As I got my phone to call Verizon, it turns out that my phone can't make phone calls! Yes, it could send and receive text messages, but no outgoing or incoming calls!? Nope! I went back to Verizon to deal with this issue, to talk about the 6gb plan, and to ask about to $5/month extra charge!

I find most cell phone companies to be about the same, but Verizon does have exceptional coverage. Since my husband is already with Verizon we decided to keep his plan, add me to his plan, and get rid of my T-Mobile plan. The great thing about switching services these days is the ability of the new provider to just do it for you. All I did was provide my account number.

"My nine month old Blackberry 9900 stops working Friday night. Won't charge, won't turn on, nothing. It didn't get wet, didn't drop it, wasn't siting in extreme heat, nothing. I turned the sound off to go into the bank, and when I came out and tired to turn the sound back on, dead phone.

I take it to Verizon Wireless the following day, and what a shock: they want to force me to get another phone. Because at Verizon, they don't fix phones, they take your money. In December I had to get a new phone for a similar problem, but was in in DC working. They took one look at the phone and said I had to get a new one. I told that to the Verizon guy at the Flamingo/Sandhill location in Vegas (I think his name was David) and he just sighed and rolled his eyes and said ""We don't know what's wrong with your phone.""

Yeah. No shit.

I point out that my other phone, the one that their DC partners said was dead and there was no way to fix it last December, now suddenly works again. Again he sighs, looks at me and says I'm going to need a new phone, it will arrive Tuesday.

Go without a phone for four or five days? Oh hell no. 

So I ask him to activate my old phone, you know the one that was supposedly dead. He can, but their system is down. 

I ask if I would be getting a refund for this new phone that is now dead, that my parents purchased because I was told my old phone was dead, but now that phone is miraculously working. No refunds for you I'm told, your warranty ended last month. So I'm being sent a replacement phone which is probably someone's used phone that Verizon told them was dead and they'd have to get a new phone.

Verizon has great service when it comes to phone usage, but when you actually need customer service? You are fucked. 

And it wasn't just me who was getting attitude and not help, another woman was having trouble with her three day old phone and the Verizon guy was being sassy with her.

It's 2013, people are addicted to their phones. When it breaks, we panic, we want help. We don't understand what's going on and we go to our phone carriers for answers. I understand some customers are rude and pushy (trust me, I was not, when he was sighing and rolling his eyes at me, I felt the Strong Black Woman bubbling up inside of me, and I went and sat down) but it doesn't help the situation when you just throw rudness and pushiness right back. 

Try to be nicer Verizon employees, and learn how to fix people's phones!

"Going to the cell phone store is usually a true test of one's patience. Long wait times, less than knowledgeable staffs and high priced equipment. For the longest time the Verizon store at Rainbow and Charleston fit this description to a tee, but lately it seems that they have worked to change that business model. 
  One of the things that have changed at this location is that upon entering the store you are immediately approached by an employee who asks what you are there for. This allows them to route you to the appropriate person to help you. This little change in the way business is done seems to have expedited the process. 
  All in all you are still going to the cell phone store which is only fun if you are getting a new device. Outside of that, it's like getting a root canal.

He then mentioned that they had a promotion with the tablets and stated that because we are connecting service with them we had the option of getting it for free. He kept on mentioning that since we are opening a line we can obtain one with just including it to the iPhone plan. He also stated that because the phone was given to us we did not have a contract with Verizon and that the plan could be cancelled at anytime with no charge. It sounded like a good deal to us. He continued to say that the plan was going to be $143 and since my employer was assigned to them I had a 20% discount.  We only lasted with the service for two months as the discount never went thru and it was too much money. We ended up switching to another service provider. Two months later after cancelling service I receive a bill of $81 dollars once I called to see what it was Kelly from the Verizon call center mentioned that the charge was for the tablet that was never cancelled and I had a two yr contract. Never once was I told that I was making a two yr if I would I would have never gotten it. Also to cancel the contract it would be $155 plus what ever the bill cycle ended with.

"Erich Kritemeyer, Is the worse customer service person in the business, he was horrible. Tripped over his own verb age did not know the contract. Could not explain why he did not have an answer but he sure wanted to sell me a phone. That was the answer just buy a new phone we will give you a deal. I already had an iphone and I was unable to get the device turned on and it is because of some red tape no one had any paper work on that would produce a decision. every one said it was illegal to have possession of the phone but when I produced a police report I bought the phone they shut up. I also went to a different store where they printed off a duplicate recite and they were not happy because for every answer they had I had a point they were wrong.I also had them lookk in the records and see I purchased the iphone. He then began quoting me the law I said thats not whats in the report unless you have law enforcement degree you should not quote the law. I reminded him he could not even quote the liability clause he was so sure to stand by but could not prove he was right. I asked if while I was in the store could I call the customer service line they said yeah. He cut me off from the call. I have no idea why. the manager had to come over an reconnect the call. I told Erich I felt like i was in a circle jerk and he said first of all that language is not allowed. I said what language. He said I do not like your language I am offended. I looked right at him and said is it Erich (wanting to make sure I pronounced his name correct) What are your referring to when you say language. Because I call customer service they tell me to come here I come here you tell me to call customer service to me that is a circle jerk. he said I was offending him I said this whole situation is offensive to me!  Your lack of customer service is offensive. I paid good money for a phone i cannot turn on because of a legality which is really just an ethical decision that no one wants to make because there is no clarification on the liability clause you have just surfaced. I realize that is a new thing for this company but it is well defined your employees both front and back office as they were termed to me would not and could not produce any paper work substantiating the fact I could not get a new number linked to my device. But they were all too happy to allow me to purchase a new phone. Is this how Verizon does business this seems like a close fine line to extortion to me.
Are managers or store owners  like Erich the new faces of sell sell sell. Why was someone allowed to procure a line from my plan when they were not financially sound to do so. Isn't that how the housing market got in this fix. Now that the person ha had a change in heart and will no longer make payments on his line and hasn't for some time I am locked out of a device. i offered to take back over the line and resume liability of the line in question. I just wanted to use my phone. I was told over the phone by customer service on more than one occasion that it is a simple switch of the number he continues to pay on the number and a new number is put on my device. this old number is put on ""blank device"".  Or in Mr. Motts case the number is not being paid on and you guys can deal with that. 
He was a former Verizon wireless service manager and manipulated the system. I realize he is not employed there any more and I realize you may never employ him again but why must i suffer in the after math. is that the plan sell phones to people and not allow them to use them. There was no clause saying I resend my permission. I did it with in the allowed 60 days as I was quoted on the phone. This should of been a easy reversal. once I said that, Erich said it was 30 days once I said fine the original request to resend was now 7 days ago I have been doing this all week well with in the 30 days allowed and not all the notes have made it in the system. Erich then told me 14 days. Really!???! Had a thought quick enough and I said I did it 10 days after I sent it would he then have said 9 days.... please this is just one small example of how horrible Erich knew the Verizon policy and how disengaging he was on the store site. when he wasn't trying to argue the law with me he was hiding in back wouldn't come out and talk with me. Erich had Ayham the manager do most of the talking. Ayham wanted to help wanted to work it out and  also wanted to sell a phone as a LAST resort.
At one point Erich's hands were shaking should I have been worried that his lack of responsibility and convoluted explanation of policy which could not be physically produced would of turned violent. Or was was he just nervous because he was lying and I was on the verge of getting a clue about all the legal convolution being dispensed in my direction to try and get my to buy a new phone.

Last Saturday I went into the retail location to purchase a car charger.  The place was super busy.  The guy at the check in station said no problem, ran to the back, got the charger, rang me up and I was out the door in under 5 minutes.  Great.
Well, turns out I don't need the charger.  
So I just went in to return it. No big deal right?
Wrong.
The girl at the check in station said that they only do things first come first serve and I'm looking at AT LEAST AN HOUR before I can be helped.  Um, what?  An hour or more to return an item for refund?  I don't need tech help, or a new phone/plan or help with existing service or equipment.  I just want to return the charger.  If it was really a first come first served system, then they had no problem skipping me to the front of the line for me to spend money.  But they won't for a simple cash register transaction return? If that is really the system.  

I am seriously dumbfounded.  I've never heard anything so absurd in my life!
I called Verizon headquarters/corporate to lodge a complaint and the woman who took my call said SHE was surprised that they said that.  Said she has never heard of something so awful, and that she would be pretty upset about it too.  She was more than just a sympathetic report taker, she was dumbfounded as well.

He asked a co-worker Gina if he could borrow her battery for a minute so we could have a definitive answer. She said NO (in a really rude tone) and explained that I'll need to wipe my phone to see if it still doesn't work. I told her I needed to be able to make sure my G Cloud backed up my phone, plus wiping it with 6% battery life would cause the phone to shut off in the middle of it and brick my phone, a chance she thought I should take. 
Well even if I could wipe it without bricking it, I'm not going to just wipe my phone if it's a battery issue. She said they don't have any batteries laying around, I said well he asked if we could use yours real quick and you said no, she then rolled her eyes and walked away. I asked her to come back so we could keep discussing this but she refused. 

David apologized and said he shouldn't have put her on the spot like that. 
He was just trying to think outside the box and come up with a quick solution to my phone not charging. So he went to talk to the manager to see if she had any ideas. 

In the mean time I went over to the display phones, took the battery out and put it in my phone, plugged it in and got the answer we needed. It's the port, not the battery. I could hear the manager yelling at David...everyone could. He got yelled at for asking Gina to borrow her battery and for allowing me to take the battery out of a phone. He didn't tell me to do it, I did it all on my own since his co-workers and manager were completely worthless. 

Since I purchased it at Costco ($70 cheaper plus awesome accessories) I had the option of having them send me a new one or just exchanging it at Costco. I obviously went that route.

"My son knocked my smartphone out of my hand and cracked the screen and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 4 months so I decided to buy a phone off of craigslist to get my by for a few months. I needed a new sim card for the phone that I planned on purchasing and wasn't going to be able to meet the craigslist seller  until after the Verizon store was closed.  I work 40+ hours a week and can't get in to these stores unless I have a day off so I decided in order to be able to get my phone up and running I would need to get a sim card during store hours..

When I walked in the ""greeter"" told me that they couldn't give me a sim card so I asked if I could buy one she said ""no, because there free"" and I said great well whats the issue then, and she refused to provide one. After I realized that I just wasted my time and money going to this store I decided to go down the street to a local ""Mybullfrog"" Verizon store. They were extremely helpful and provided the sim card with no trouble. I would not recommend the big box Verizon Stores when you can get much better customer service in the same area at a Mybullfrog/ Verizon Wireless store.",1,0,0,0,7,2,3,8,4.33333333333333,0.285714285714286,1.23809523809524,2,3,2
"This Happy Valley Store is the worst customer service I have ever seen.  I went in there on a Tuesday night and there was a 90 minute wait, therefore I left.  I ordered a replacement phone via phone,  I ordered the blue I phone.  When I was told it was blue I figured blue not baby blue.  When the phone was delivered I called the Happy Valley store and asked if I could switch it out for a white one and they said sure.  So I proceeded to the store and waited about 10 minutes (that is a heck of a lot better than 90 minutes)  I was then informed by my customer service rep that there would be a $35.00 re-stocking fee.  REALLY???? WHY was I not told that on the phone when I called....  I proceeded to ask for the manager.  I was told the same thing about the re-stocking fee.  So I asked for his manager and he proceeded to tell me he was not available.  I asked for his business card so JEFF went in the back for about 5 minutes to grab a business card - came out gave it to me and informed me that h has all ready spoke to his manager and nothing is going to change.  WELL for one I am sure his manager was sitting in the back and it is kind of funny that he told me his manager was not available BUT he was able to go in back and speak to him.  I have called Jeff's manager Jeremy and have not gotten a returned phone call back.   I could go on forever, but I will stop.  MY POINT IT THIS STORE AT HAPPY VALLEY HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  THEY NEED TO TRAIN ALL THE EMPLOYEES TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE. AND WHEN I CALLED AND ASKED IF I COULD EXCHANGE THE PHONE THAT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN USED, THAT EMPLOYEE SHOULD OF SAID ABSOLUTELY BUT BE AWARE THERE IS A $35.00 RESTOCKING FEE - MIND YOU TO PUT A PHONE ON THE SHELF.

"After spending nearly $200 signing up as a new customer my phone completely died within two months. After Jon fiddled with it for 20 minutes he told me I'd have to have a replacement shipped and I'd have to pay overnight shipping. I would also have to drive to a FedEx location and ship my old phone back. They offered me a loaner but that would have involved another trip back to the store. I was irritated that they couldn't replace my phone there or at least let me pay the difference for an upgrade. As I got irritated Jon got defensive and basically kept interrupting me..he did talk to his manager but he seemed to care even less...I basically left with a yellow sticky with the customer service number on it..WOW!

"To whom It May Concern:

I pre-ordered 2 iPhone 5's for my business and was promissed on the 14th that they would be delivered to me no later than 9-21-2012 by the phone representative that took my order.  I subsequently received an email stating that they would not be delivered until 9-26.  I called and spoke with a representative regarding this who assured me that I would be receiving the phones on Friday the 21st.  Yesterday evening I received an email stating that it would be the 26th or later and that you could not guarantee when I was recieving them. Today I called, spoke to one rep who could not verify anything other than that the phones had not shipped and would not be shipped today.  I asked to speak to his supervisor who's only solution was to cancel the order.  I asked to speak to his supervisior and was told he would take my number and someone would get back to me in 24-48 hours.  I explained that this was not acceptable and to please transfer me to his supervisor.  After 15 minutes of me asking to be transferred, him stating that he was not refusing to transfer but only offering to take my number and have someone contact me back, he said to hold he would transfer me.  So far, I have been on hold for 43 minutes and 15 seconds as of the time that I am writing this.  This is not acceptable.  As a business custormer with Verizon Wireless for many years, I would think that you would have better customer service than this.  This is the quickest way to loose a customer.

I was greeted quickly and within 5 minutes I made it to the top of the list and had a trainee and a trainer waiting on me.  Told them what I was looking at and why.  They unlocked one of each so I could hold the phones, both were much larger than my old phone.  We talked about each one's strong points and I ended up with another Motorola so I would have a short learning curve.

"I went down to this store in hopes of upgrading mine and my wife's phone last weekend. After talking to the representative we were told that we were not eligible to use the edge program due to not having six months of good payments. We had five months of good payments, the only break within our multi year contract of good payments, where we had auto payments, was one month where we had fraud on our account and the Verizon wireless back office told us not to make our payment so they could fix the fraud on our account that they had allowed to happen. A week later I decided to call the back office in hopes that they could put a remark on my account ""saying that it was okay for myself and my wife to use the edge program because the problem with our billing was due to fraud."" Verizon wireless's back-office put me on hold well they called my local store. After about 20 minutes of being on hold the back office person told me that the store cannot do anything and back office cannot do anything and the only choice that I have is to call a third person and go through a long process with them and ""maybe"" they can help me. I can except the fact that even though after being a Verizon wireless customer for over 10 years, they are over charging me for every thing and I'm losing my unlimited data plan, the one thing that I cannot except and will not forget is they are denying me privileges and services they give to every one else because I had a lapse in payment due to an error they made. I am being punished because they could not keep their website secure and when I called to try and fix it they pretty much told me ""sucks to be you, nothing I can do about it."" It took me over two months to fix this fraud on my account where Verizon Wireless allowed someone to run up almost $2000 in charges on a phone line, they talked me into, that does not even work.

"I needed a new cell phone, and I was tired of dealing with all the headaches buying phones and plans from websites.  So I knew that even though it might cost a bit more, it was time to visit a local storefront and, when I had questions, there would be a live person available to answer them.

My mistake!  The live people who staff this place seem to be dead from the neck up.  I told a clerk named Stacy I needed a phone.  She was happy to push a ""smart phone"" with an expensive contract plan.  When I said I wanted a ""dumb phone"" with no contract, her face literally dropped.  Then she disappeared for 20 minutes under guise of finding me a phone in the back that could use their prepaid plan.

When she finally came back, I began asking my annoying questions, the kind that customers insist upon asking because they don't work with the product full-time.  No problem for Stacy, though.  She ignored every one of my questions and did whatever she could to finish with me ASAP.

I asked a total of four times how to operate the voice mail, and all four times they decided I said something else and informed me, ""This phone doesn't get e-mail.""

I still wound up buying the phone and a prepaid plan since I had no phone at the time.  I came back later in the week to ask my questions to someone else (forget his name).  But all he could do was get irritated with me because I kept asking questions about the flip phone I'd bought, and he told me, repeatedly, ""I don't use the flip phone!""

I'm not condemning Verizon Wireless--my service, as well as the online customer service, has been acceptable thus far.  But the clerks and management at this particular store exhibit no interest in their customers (at least not the ones who aren't there to pay top dollar for everything) and no knowledge of any phones other than the ones they themselves use.

"Ok Verizon...so close,  yet so far from good. My phone hasn't worked right for several months, but since it had been over a year since I  purchased it I assumed I'd have to wait out my contract. After weeks of my phone getting worse and worse (and purchasing a new battery) I decided to check with Verizon about my actual options. 

I walked in and someone immediately greeted me and informed me that I was next in line.  About five minutes later someone was helping me. He asked me a few questions and informed me that Verizon could send me a new phone at no charge. What!?! I never thought that was even possible! Yay! What made it even better is he said it would arrive in 1-2 days. I was so excited. I went home to wait. About an hour later I received a tracking update that said it was scheduled to arrive the following day by 8pm. Yay, again. 
The phone was in my hand by the next afternoon. Super excited to switch my stuff over I researched the best way to do it and found Verizon cloud. But when I looked at the app it seemed as though I would need both phones linked to my account before I could switch or so I thought. Not realizing there was a way around this I brought both phones a to Verizon. 

This time when I walked in there was no one to greet me, but it was kinda late (about an hour or so until close) so I just waited near the door for someone to become available. A female manager finished up with her customer and came over to check me in. Here's where I think the problem starts.... I explain in detail to her about what I am trying to do, and she agrees that Verizon cloud is great and lets me know I'm in the queue. I waited about 15 minutes and then someone approaches. He takes both of my phones and immediately removes SD and SIM card from old phone and places in the new phone.  At this point I try to interject that I want to make sure all of the stuff from the old phone go to the new phone and ask if I need to do something before he removes the cards. He doesn't really look up just shakes his head and continues on.

I'm not an idiot, but I'm also not a tech person so I trust that he knows what he is doing. He tells me that it will take several hours to backup so I should go home so that it can do it over wifi. And off I go, after several hours later....I finally feel asleep and woke up to those sweet words ""backup complete"" yay... or not. Upon examination of my phone I notice none of the messages transferred over and only a portion of the photos. What the hell?

So on my own accord I moved the cards back to the original phone and I'm currently in the long process of backing up again. I feel like either they didn't understand what I was really asking or they don't care. It's just annoying. Customer service is about listening to ensure you really understand what the customer is asking. I know these guys deal with difficult and unhappy people all day, but I was none of those things.

"The store gets .5 star 
 - A store rep gave false information to an Verizion Phone Rep who called into this location to confirmed what was in stock, type of electric, and a current iPad deal with a purchase of an iPhone.  
- No MANAGER came to diffuse a situation after an encounter with a loud verbally hostile employee.  Just because ""Thank you"" was used, it boils down to attitude and delivery.  Spare me the sugarcoat to your attitude and belittling demeanor.
- I requested for the District Manager's contact information yet the best they could do, was have me write my information down on a business card which would be submitted to the district manager after he returns from Maternity leave- very professional.

If I could reward a negative star, CHRISTOL is surely deserving of it.
- Rude, loud, and very talented at belittling customers, instead of getting to her point.
- Disrespectful to her own customers by disrupting her own sales to intrude into mines.
- Sugar coats the attitude with kosher wording.
- Disrespectful to her own coworkers.  Instead of helping them, she just takes over the conversation.  Chris (my sales rep) and myself were both unaware of the FINE PRINT retail cost price which would have easily answered my question, which was directed towards him.   I do not need someone trying to educate me on simple math- I can subtract 100 from the amount.  

My plan was in and out...  Get my phone, get my bro's iPad, and get out.  All these issues stemmed from false information given to my brother that lead me to encounter the wonderful holiday spirits of Christol.  

Solutions:
- This store Manager really needs to have a meeting to explain proper customer service etiquette.
- Also discuss proper communication etiquette between co-workers
- And a Manager should be present to diffuse the situation.  In my mind should taken the initiative to join into the conversation rather then being summoned.   One manager in the back was fully aware of what was going on on the floor and never came to talk to me- my Sale Rep spoke to him twice without me present.  Maybe it is my fault for not asking to speak to a Manager, who knows
- Communication is key and knowledge of current sales or deals.
- Christol is her own world operating by her own rules, cleverly attempting to sugarcoat it all- enough said...",1,0,0,0,21,-2,9,23,10,-0.0952380952380952,1.39047619047619,8,8,5

"I have a confession.  I am a borderline smartphone addict. It is a condition affecting 40 percent of Americans. Although I don't suffer from Nomophobia and on a survey questionaire, I did not reach the point of needing smart phone detox; I am a heavy smartphone user. I have even been guilty of phubbing. When things go wrong with a smartphone,  it is a bad deal for the borderline smartphone addict.

  Things go wrong so frequently with my sensitive Galaxy 3, that gaining dukedoms to Verizon is becoming a rite of passage with owning this phone. This past week, the phone was acting up. After using the Cardio Trainer app to measure the distance of the River Mountain South Powerline Trail (remember I am a border smartphone addict) the SD card gave up on me. Years of pictures and a 100 of the greatest hits of all time perished from my World. It was time to return to the equivalent of the emergency room for Verizon  smartphone owners: the corporate Verizon Store.

  The Sunset at Stephanie Verizon store is as modern as the IPhone 5. The store reminds me of an Apple Store, where you get to play around with the new smartphones and tablets. It is a smart concept. When people are waiting to be called, if your like me your thinking, ""my smartphone is getting out of date (scary since I only brought it last year, but I am a borderline smartphone addict), maybe I should extend my contract another year and a half, get a new phone that will be old in a year, and never get out of my contract.""  In reality,  I am loyal to my smartphones, and if you've read my earlier Yelp reviews, I keep them til they pass on. Past the displays of the newest smartphones and tablets is the automatic bill pay machines and the accessaries wall. After spending time with the latesr technology, it dawns on me that the basic cell phones have gone the way of my SD card.

  When I look at the accessaries wall, I am reminded of why I brought the Galaxy 3 and prior to that the Fascinate at Best Buy. Everything at the Verizon Store is inflated. An example is they wanted $40 for a 16 GB SD card that I brought yesterday from Walmart for $16. A more disturbing sight is there are no accessories for the Galaxy 3. I only brought it 11 months ago! Just like I see expensive places, there merchandising plants the seeds in my head for the fruits that will be business with Best Buy and any brick & mortor electronics place.

  By the time that I look at all this technology,  the Verizon rep calls my name. When I went here on Thursday for a busted SD card and yesterday for a battery draining rapidly due to looking for an SD card, the reps were patient and professional. I am a borderline smartphone addict that is respectful. I can understand some of the irrate customers they have to deal with. Anyway my opinion of the reps is they are more of the equivalent of smartphone therapists than doctors. On Thursday, the rep even volunteered to clean my screen and did a cold battery charge. Unlike the downtown Seattle Verizon (I reviewed  this recently) and the Flamingo at Sandhill Verizons, they passed over trying to sell me stuff. As far as smartphone doctors, they are like 2G reception. The best they have done is go on forums for advice. So, youtube videos have benefitted me more for understanding technical issues. And in earlier visits, especially with the Fascinate, the solution was always its the apps or you have to do a factory reset.

   It is very difficult for me to bestow a Verizon Store with more than 3 stars. There is zero excuse for not having replacement phones for a broken one. It is a bad deal for a borderline smartphone addict to be without a phone. And in general it is a bad deal for any smartphone money paying good money for service to be without the device during the time that Verizon ships a replacement,  when it should be in their corporate owned shops.

  Let's put it this way, my Galaxy 3 is not getting any smarter. When it turns into a dumbphone, I will have to return to a Verizon Corporate Store. If I am still the Duke, it is out of necessity and not a choice for this borderline smartphone addict.",3,3,4,3,41,-6,14,9,5.66666666666667,-0.146341463414634,1.0280487804878,14,11,16

Employees here are nice enough. They convince you to purchase over-priced and useless shit (accessories). They might even distract you well enough that you fail to notice that their corporate headquarters in New York, New York is fucking you sans lube.

"The miss' finally decided to start living in the now and wanted to upgrade to her first smartphone. We had to go to the mall for other stuff so we figured we'd just do it while we were there, rather than going to the store I prefer that is closer to us. The service was decent but I was a bit put off by some things.

One of the things I like about going into most Verizon stores is that there is either a ""greeter"" to get you checked in, or you can check yourself in. This ensures that everyone is helped based on the order they enter, much like tickets at a deli counter. This place didn't have that, so it was a matter of having to hang out near the sales reps so that when they were done they would turn to you next, as opposed to someone who walked in after you. The other thing I don't like about this location is that there are very few phones on display. Not only are there almost none to look at on the walls, but even when you sit down with someone to look at models they give you phones that are either not charged up or are locked so you can't play around with them too much. This makes the decision process a bit frustrating as it's difficult to take all the potential choices for a quick test spin.

The rep who helped us was friendly and pretty knowledgeable which helped the process go much faster. My wife told him what she wanted (a basic smartphone that wouldn't cost her anything out of pocket) and he brought out the three phones that met that criteria. I was glad he didn't waste time trying to change her mind and upsell her a better model. It was just a pain that two of the three phones were not useable, though the one that worked was the best choice for her anyway. We also decided to finally switch over to a family share plan to save cash on the data useage fees, and they were able to do that. It took a super long time for the corporate customer service number to pick up and help us, but that was Verizon in general, not this store.

In the end it was a decent enough Verizon experience, and the miss' proclaimed that it was the easiest trip to a Verizon store she has ever had to make. For me, I like being able to check in so I can see how much of a wait I have ahead of me, and I definitely want to be able to use the different phones before making a decision on what I'm going to buy.

I got helped by a very professional, enthusiastic salesman. My wife and I were switching from AT&T and he was very helpful in setting us up.

One thing I have noticed with Verizon stores in general, which may help answer some of the issues others seem to have with them - they employ excellent salesmen, but subpar technicians, customer service, etc. So its pretty easy for them to get you onto their network, but once you have a problem, you are not dealing with their salesmen, but their technicians who may not as good as you expect them to be.

"Being a minimalist person and not requiring cable, tivo, 3D TVs and the like, I haven't had the internet at home for years. J and I both have laptops and when you can go to a coffee shop or hop on the net at work or from your smart phone, who really needs it? Well, I'm going back to school, so I do.

I went into the store and a sales rep eagerly came to ask if I needed assistance, I declared, ""yes! I need home internet service"" what would I be using this for and how many devices would I be connecting she asked. ""2 laptops and an XBOX. We watch a lot of streaming Netflix movies and play online video games (J was so pumped he'd be able to play online again, after 3 years)."" This would be perfect for you then she exclaimed, showing me the MiFi. You can connect up to 5 devices and its a sinch to hook up... only $100 with a $50 rebate and your employee discount waives activation fee and $50 a month for service. Sweeeet, I thought, so I purchased it.

NEVER was a data plan discussed with me and NEVER was a data plan explained to me. So imagine my shock when I went online to check some stuff (my little sis is on my account and sometimes downloads a lot so I monitor it) my bill was already $958!!! 5 days into the cycle. Yes! 5 days in. Tears welled up in my eyes and I called J and K to stop using their phones until I got this shit taken care of. Come to find out I was on a 5gb plan and every gig I went over I was being charged $10. We were at 67gb. Verizon's largest package was 10gb. 

Maybe I should have asked more questions but I told the woman what we used the net for. Surfing, streaming, gaming. Why this was never explained to me is beyond my comprehension.

(i'm really hoping this works considering the phone started doing this even after it was relatively new so i'm not quite sure how resetting it will solve the problem anyway...) and while it was resetting, she proceeded to flirt with an ex-employee who happened to stop by.

"To whom It May Concern:

I pre-ordered 2 iPhone 5's for my business and was promissed on the 14th that they would be delivered to me no later than 9-21-2012 by the phone representative that took my order.  I subsequently received an email stating that they would not be delivered until 9-26.  I called and spoke with a representative regarding this who assured me that I would be receiving the phones on Friday the 21st.  Yesterday evening I received an email stating that it would be the 26th or later and that you could not guarantee when I was recieving them. Today I called, spoke to one rep who could not verify anything other than that the phones had not shipped and would not be shipped today.  I asked to speak to his supervisor who's only solution was to cancel the order.  I asked to speak to his supervisior and was told he would take my number and someone would get back to me in 24-48 hours.  I explained that this was not acceptable and to please transfer me to his supervisor.  After 15 minutes of me asking to be transferred, him stating that he was not refusing to transfer but only offering to take my number and have someone contact me back, he said to hold he would transfer me.

"I have to say, in the 9 years or so that I have continued, for some reason, to use Verizon as my wireless phone company, that their overall report card would be about a C- or D. I can't count the number of dropped calls, missed calls (many of them important personal and business calls), and now bait and switch tactics that I find to be the nail in the coffin for me continuing to employ Verizon at all. I was promised a ""free upgrade"" to the iPhone 4S back in Jan. 2011, effective Sept. 2012, a fact which was made clear by Verizon reps, and embedded in clear language on the My Verizon part of my online account. Now, as I go to verify the details of that ""free upgrade"", I am told in no uncertain terms by a rep that ""No, we've never offered that, you'll have to pay for that phone and the upgrade fee of $30"". 

Case in point, Verizon are a bunch of racketeering charlatans who deserve a massive class action lawsuit due to their shoddy phone service, poor customer service, empty bait-and-switch promises (lies), litany of missed and dropped calls, and more. I hate that I pay $97 per month to hope and wonder if I will get that important business call tomorrow instead of today, or that the call will suddenly be dropped in the middle of important conversations.

"Isn't it just typical of Verizon to have sent me this reply to this review last week, only to not reply to me like they said they would. And since customer service is one of major nits with these people, for me, the ball is in their court, which they have failed to return:

""I am very concerned about your experience with our company Chris! I apologize for the inconvenience you had with your upgrade as well as the service! Allow me the opportunity to restore your confidence in Verizon Wireless. You deserve the best customer service and I am here to give that to you! I would like to address your concerns with the dropped calls and provide you information about your upgrade. Please reply back with your full name and mobile number. I will contact you to better assist!""

I gave them my name and number last week, and have not heard back from them. And, I'm not going to go chasing a lame duck. And, now that I read that Verizon donates millions of our dollars to political special interests (which don't have OUR best interests at heart), it just keeps nailing the coffin shut for me. Yes, other big name mobile communications companies use their huge profits for political influence, but almost everything about the way Verizon does business, and fails in its service approach puts them at the bottom of the list behind AT&T , T-Mobile, etc. These companies are dominating our lives because they know, or figure upon the fact that we can't do without our mobile devices. But, what if we all took that power back, and formed a union, and jumped ship en masse? We would bring them to their knees. Who's with me?

And hey, Verizon, how about no more mandatory software ""upgrades"" that actually slow my phone down and mess it up, with lost settings, that simply pisses me off! And, when will my phone ring when the ringer is turned on? Should I ask for a rebate check for the myriad of lost and deferred calls--some which have cost me a potential client? And, are you going to make good on your promise of a free upgrade to iPhone4S, or was that all golden carrot-dangling mularkey?

Update: 8/19 -The customer service rep who responded below, just like the last person, asked for my info to get right back to me with, and of course, never did. Or, maybe she tried, and the phone never rang, being Verizon. I think I am going to sue Verizon for all my money back + damages. $97 x 20 months = $1,940.

"I have dealt with this store for years and had OK service in the past but recently the staff here went way above and beyond to help me out.

I have a commercial account and I needed to add two phones. Last Wednesday, Michelle helped me and directed me toward two phones that were free but also had a $100 bill credit each, after the first month. (Score)

I also needed some tablets. I already have a few Samsung Galaxy 6"" tablets that work well. Michelle told me they were on sell for $100 and they would each have a $25 credit to my account. I decided to wait on the tablets as I don't need them for about a month. However I had a bad car charger that was only about a month old and Michelle got a manager to replace it for me free of charge. (Score again)

A week later I get a call from Michelle at the Verizon store, The Samsung Galaxy Tablets are now FREE with a 2 year plan and I still get the $25 bill credit. I asked her to grab me 3 and I would be in the next day to get them. (Score Again,)

I have never had a sales rep pay that much attention to my needs but it didn't stop there, she knew I needed cases for the tablets and this store was out so she stopped by another store the next morning and got the cases from them so I wouldn't have to make another trip. (Score again)

I had 3 tablets that were eligible for upgrades so we upgraded those, got 3 more, got cases and I needed some other accessories that the manager couldn't discount but she authorized another $100 credit to my account.

"The process of changing my family over from Tmobile to Verizon involved two visits to this store (not their fault).   

The first visit, I was quite underwhelmed by two major drawbacks.  The first was that a grumpy man (the apparent store manager, shift manager, or something fairly important) came up to us as soon as we got in the store.  He was holding a tablet and stylus and looking down at his screen.  ""Name?"" he asked us.  I was like, ""What?""  I mean normally when you walk in a public store that has a lot of space to look around, you're allowed free range -- not immediately accosted in the first 20 inches of real estate with no greeting and no explanation of why this retail store insists on getting the name of every person who walks in the store.  ""How does he even know I want to sign up for the 'I need organized help' list??"", I wondered.  Eventually I asked him why he needed my name to walk in the store, he offered the generous explanation ""To get help"".  I gave my name, but his process did not seem to help the situation out much (took about 30 min to get ""help"" -- I think I would have fared better by just insisting on wandering around the store and then asking for help when I was ready.  The overall process of not being allowed to do this was quite off putting.
Then a younger fellow began helping us.  He seemed very ignorant of the options available and not at all good at dealing with people, even after we explained our objective.  I don't feel like it's appropriate to use the public internet (i.e., Yelp) to out people by name for non-eggregious behavior during negative reviews, so I'll leave them unnamed.

The next day we came back.  Michelle Jacoby helped us out and she was absolutely amazing.  I was worried because I'm NOT a fan of businesses that staff their ""help"" team with what seem like teenage girls but after we started talking, I realized this was not the case..and after we got into it a little, we realized that she was really in tune with what we needed and wanted and was willing to always tell us ALL the options that pertained.  She was creative at solving our needs and we are VERY HAPPY with our brand new Samsung Galaxies, and the children love their tablets (which were FREE, thanks to Michelle's knowledge of a coming sale, which allowed us to pay $50/tablet up front, then get them both refunded a week later).

"The short review: Customer service reps are generally helpful, but the sales guy is a scammer. Watch out and be sure you ask all questions anticipating any situation or they will make sure it always works only to their advantage and not to the customer's.  Now the long review...here's what happened to us:

I got a phone on my normal upgrade time. I wanted one with a keyboard. NOT a touchscreen, since I'd had problems with a previous touchscreen phone. They sold me an LG ENV3 at a different location. However, I had to buy a data package. Had to. Apparently it was the Verizon Law.  I bought the cheapest I could--$10/month. I barely used the data package, because the screen was too small for you to see anything on any web browser. It's NOT a smartphone. just a regular phone. Ripoff #1 for this series of events.

About a year and a half later, I visit this particular location by Chandler Mall. The helpful customer service rep mentioned that perhaps I'd like to check into a smartphone. I told him what features I used and was looking for (including a full keyboard) and he showed me the one I could get when my plan was up or upon early upgrade time. 

Maybe a month later, my phone started giving me problems. It wasn't working right. I went back in, looking for the same helpful guy, thinking I could give him the sale. He was off, and he wasn't a sales person. I told the manager how helpful he was, anyway, in case his raise was coming up or bonus time or something. They gave me another sales person. He informed me that they were having a buy 1, get 1 free sale on the smartphones I was looking at. Oh, but because of this sale, they were out of stock--phone on backorder. They could order it to be shipped to my house. It would take about 8 days. 8 days without a phone? No. He suggested that I use an old one. I had no old one. He then convinced me that there was the exact same phone w/o a keyboard..and NO ONE wanted the keyboard phones now; they were becoming obsolete. He was skeptical at first, but he got used to the touch-screen keyboard and was sure I would, too.  Ok, I relented, since I felt like I had to get SOMEthing.  I asked if I could get the free one as the other one on backorder and they just ship it to me. No, he said. 

I took the phone home, without instructions, figuring there must be a user guide--there always was before. No. Just a quickstart guide. not even a tutorial online. I had to ask my facebook friends how to do things. 6 mos later, I still was having a hard time typing. I actually called a few months before that to ask the store if I could trade my other phone, never removed from the box, for the one I originally wanted. ""Has it been more than 14days?"" yes, I said. ""Then, no, there's nothing you can do"".   So, I got so disgusted one day that I went online to chat with a cust svc rep online. He told me to call and even though the store couldnt' do anything, cust svc COULD get me a different phone.  I called. A very helpful guy told me that the stores have loaner phones and he should have offered me one of those until my phone came in. OR, he could have offered to sell me a really cheap phone and return it in the 14day window. AND, he most certainly COULD have given me the other phone as my 2nd phone and had it shipped to me. Unethical of the salesman, but nothing cust service could do except recommend that I sell my other new phone on Craigslist and use that $ to get an early upgrade approved by cust svc for the phone I wanted. FYI we had been Verizon customers for 10 years at this point.

I chose not to do that. I chose to change cell phone companies with more ethical salespeople.  I also called cust service later to ask them some question, and they asked me about my son's phone, and I said he can't use the data package, (same as my ENV3) and so he never uses it. They said, you dont' have to have the data package. If you block all data, we will cancel the fee for the data package!  Apparently this had always been an option, but not one salesperson from Verizon had ever told me this (including the abovementioned unethical one who also activated the other ENV3 we had gotten from my son's aunt for him to have).  Enter this store if you need to purchase something at your own risk. If you're just looking, it should be ok.",2,0,1,1,61,5,0,19,8,0.0819672131147541,0.50983606557377,10,12,39

"Ok first off I have been a long time, and I mean long time, customer of Verizon Wireless... I'm talkin 15 years! So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package. I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all. Specifically, my unlimited data plan. In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also. They told him the same thing, that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to. So fast forward to today, June 20th, I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road. The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to. I'm like, what?!?!?! I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract. He told me, and these were his words, ""Well, the lied to you""! WTH!!!!! I was majorly p'd off!!!!! I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out. So, I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence, the Verizon rep. Blah blah blah.... can I please speak to your manager... 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes), Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone. She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new ""plans"" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider.

"My advice: Never ever go to the store. Just call Verizon Customer Support.

I had lost my phone and wanted an upgrade. I was due in 2 months, so I figure it wasn't a big deal. After a 2 hour wait, I was told in 5 minutes that I was SOL. They did try to sell me the ""edge"" program which pretty much meant I was either leasing a phone or paying full price. RIP OFF!!

The next day, I called Verizon Customer Support and they told me it'd be no problem since I was so close. They said I could order over the phone, but since I needed it that day, I told them to make a note of it on my account information and I would order it at the store.

I made an appointment so I wouldn't have to wait for 2 hours again. However, I was told that I needed the manager approval and she wouldn't give it. Yes, Sandra (Sandy on her name tag) the manager, would not honor the agreement Verizon Customer Support had ensured me would be no problem. Again, they tried to push me onto the ""edge"" program which I believe is a predatory program targeting those who can't pay for a phone upfront. In the end, you pay WAY MORE than if you would of paid up front for an upgrade.

After another hour and half wait, we reached Verizon Customer Support. They apologized to me and told me they could not do anything on their end because the manager of the store, Sandy, had final say. I ended up ordering the phone with Verizon Customer Support. Unfortunately, I would not receive my new phone for another 3 days.

Long story short, NEVER EVER go to the store unless you enjoy having your time wasted Everything can be handled through Verizon Customer Support. They are much more knowledgeable and helpful.",1,2,0,3,20,5,11,13,9.66666666666667,0.25,0.723684210526316,4,8,8

I trade in two iPhones which I want to put towards a new smartphone they're running a promo where I get $200/phone which was great! But sadly I was conned as the associate used up all my credit which was supposed to go towards the phone on merchandise. I asked repeatedly if my credit can go towards my bill or the phone itself, he kept saying don't worry your bill will be the same this merchandise is discounted. Awsome, I don't mind the phone case, car and travel charger, but a $200 portable speaker? I asked if the credit could go to my bill instead. Nope it doesn't work like that, then again ""how bout the phone?"" Again nope. I said why did you tell me the promo was towards the phone then? Oh it is I made sure your bill was the same. Ok then put the $200 credit towards the bill. After continuing on this cycle I finally got fed up and said just do what you got to do. I'm done. So I got some overpriced gear from my iPhone trade in and was definitely unsatisfied with the unwillingness to put any credit towards my bill or phone like I wanted.

But, they will extract as much cash out of you they can.

This has happened 3 times in the last year.  I had a battery go bad on my flip phone before that and they made me renew two years for that.

"My phone go poopie :(

So I went to tis verizon store to get a new one since im up for a new one anyway. I was shocked to learn that I had basically one choice for a new phone since i want an actual qwerty and a touch screen in a phone that does not need the data package. Is this fair? I do not want or need the internet, but i would like a quality phone that  I do not have to pay an extra $30 dollars a month for. This phone is ok at best, and to beat the band, i just happened to go on day 1 of I phone madness at verizon. So all i heard was you gotta get this phone it is the best phone out there. Dont want it, dont need it. sorry. So i decided to go home and order online, not only because it is less, but because i was frustrated with the whole pricing thing. Only to order and find that i cannot have my phone until today. I thought i saw overnight shipping if I ordered b4 3:30. Wrong, oh well. anyway that is enough ranting, I just believe that the wireless market is squeezing us all into buying a package which most of us dont really need. Remember when all we could do was page someone. then came alpha and we could text. We paid like $6 dollars and complained that was way to high. Now we pay $103 for basically the same thing. Enough said. gotta have it though. 

I should add that everyone at the store was friendly and if your in the market for a verizon phone, this is a corporate store that isnt all that busy so give it a try.

So this slick walks up in his neon sneakers, flat bill hat and think he is super fly even though he is the one working on a Saturday. He is trying to promote Verizon so hard that he is shooting off buzz words like Verizon 4G Chip set - even though I can tell he does not know what a chip set is, nor could he explain what the difference between 3G and 4G is. I know what it is, and I don't expect that this clerk should have the technical insight to explain it, but then he probably shouldn't use the terminology that comes from the brochure that he doesn't understand.

As much as I hate employees that act like they are better than their customers, even though they are working in their gym clothes - I might have been able to let this slide if it wasn't for his save of telling me I should switch plan, something I really didn't want to do, by offering me a promotion that they don't have anymore. This might look like a mistake, a mere oversight.. but this is his whole job! Push customers to get the features that creates revenue.

Learning from the hideous experience at Sprint, I made an appointment at the Verizon store for 5pm to discuss the different phone and plan options (I was debating between a Droid and the iPhone 4). That said, I don't think it would have been a problem to just walk in as the employees were all very helpful and making sure they were attending to customers as quickly as possible (maybe someone from the Sprint store, ahem Management, should stop by here to see how it's done). 

I worked with a woman named Bethany, who went above and beyond to answer all of my questions, discuss the pros and cons of both the Droid and the iPhone, and then helped me set up my phone, transfer contacts, and set up my online account. She also explained how I could go online to get my employee discount. 

In the end, I'm very happy that I switched to Verizon and am having a great time learning all the cool things the iPhone does.

However, in true fashion, I never received any call or follow up from him. Overall, I am very disheartened by, not only the lack of service but also the blatant lies to make a sale. When will businesses learn that the value of a customer is not based on a single sale but rather their long term buying potential. I am planning on switching over to a new carrier when this contract expires.

"Buying a cell phone has become a more painful experience with each passing day. If it's not the obscene fees the carriers are pulling out of their rectums, it's the aggressive and sometimes deceitful service you get at the retail stores.

This particular store was a little bi-polar.  When I purchased a new phone in December of last year it was a pleasant and low pressure interaction. I asked the rep a couple of questions (to confirm what I had already researched) which he answered correctly along with adding some info I was not aware of. Overall, it was one of the best retail experiences I've had in a long time.

Fast forward to April 8th and it was as if I had entered an entirely different store. From the first greeting you could sense the desperation in the air of ""I need to sell you something NOW."" I asked the rep a couple of questions about the phone I was interested in (which had also already been researched) and instead of getting the correct answer or even an ""I'm not sure, let me check,"" I got pure BS. It was a lame attempt to cover his ignorance while trying to pass himself off as a cell phone expert. There's nothing that pisses me off more than being lied to.  If you hadn't already guessed it, I did not purchase another phone from this store. 

The quality in purchasing experiences shouldn't vary this wildly between reps and they sure as hell shouldn't be lying to the customer either. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I'm buying my next phone online and only using this store as a demo unit showroom.",2,0,0,0,15,-7,-10,2,-5,-0.466666666666667,1.98095238095238,7,5,3

"The only thing I have to compare Verizon to is one of the major electronic stores that offers cellular phone service. Sadly, Verizon employees didn't seem as knowledgeable and weren't as customer service savy as the electronics store. The last time I did an ""upgrade"" to my cellular account and got a new phone, I went to the electronics store and got better service, from a friendlier, more knowledgeable employee. That's not to say this trip to Verizon was bad, but you would think the Verizon store would be the best place for all things Verizon. The electronic store actually had more variety to choose from when it came to upgrade options.  I don't like the fact that you cannot just come in and browse without having an employee come up with their notebook and ask for your name, account number, etc. It's almost like going to a car lot. Regardless of the price you get on an ""upgrade"", there is a thirty-dollar upgrade fee. Seems a little misleading for a free or ninety-nine cent upgrade. It looked like there had been a lot of employee turnover since my last visit to this location. My previous visits were much better, in that I dealt with employees who really knew their stuff and the customer service seemed better. We were ""assigned"" a customer service rep after signing in, but she went on to help somebody else, because we didn't know exactly what we wanted. Last time they asked about our phone habits, useage, etc. to determine which phones were best for us. This time seemed more like a cattle call and them making a sale, rather than servicing the customer. The rep we dealt with tried to upsale me a case that I didn't need, as the phone I got is billed as ""more durable"" and comes with a built in case. I don't think any other cellular provider is going to be much different, so making a switch doesn't seem too feasible. I did like that I was able to add the fees, taxes, etc. to the monthly bill and didn't have to come out of pocket for anything. I will probably go back to the big electronics store, though, for any future Verizon service, upgrades, etc.",3,1,1,2,18,12,16,7,11.6666666666667,0.666666666666667,0.352941176470588,0,11,7

"I don't normally go out of my way to write a bad review, but for the situation I came across I believe it merits one to WARN future customers who come to this location for customer service.

I came on a Saturday with an intent to buy a new phone in which the agent, Saul, assisted us with. Now, we were difficult customers to begin with because we could not completely understand the breakdown of charges they were going to give us based on various options. Saul was very nice and was very patient with us. But of course some things may be too good to be true as we all know that all agents here not only are required to provide good customer service as top priority but they also get commission. So agents will have their own agenda in mind.

Now we were given a good option to take the Edge program where we make monthly payments towards paying off a new phone. However, Saul pitched to us (of course in a very nice and charismatic way) that with the program we would pay an up front price of $140 towards some sort of ""insurance to keep the phone in good condition"" when we would have to trade it back one day. So we bought into this BS with our undivided trust on Saul to be very honest. With this ""insurance"" up front cost came ""a series of retail products that come for FREE!"" we were ecstatic! We were thinking we were getting a good value here!

I went through my receipt when I got home realizing that I was charged $140 on retail products I didn't even want! Phone car charger, screen protector, phone case, and a $60 blue tooth device. WOW! So..that's what my insurance was. I was upset and felt completely taken advantage of as no one explained to us this ""deal"" or option. I'm not quite sure if this is a Verizon sales tactic that this company trains them on or its purely developed by these agents but this is absolutely NOT COOL.

I came back to speak to the manager nicely about our predicament in which he was willing to refund everything, but no apology, and instead decided to correct me ""it's a bundle option that goes with the Edge program."" Yes, FOOL I KNOW IT'S AN OPTION NOW! However, NO ONE DECIDED TO TELL ME THAT WHEN I GOT IT THE FIRST TIME. They pitched to me AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY. Being two women who came off as incompetent because we could not understand his breakdown, I felt completely taken advantaged of. So I am livid and would NEVER GO BACK.

So, be prepared to come in with your guard up on this one...and DON'T TAKE the ""bs bundle"" unless you really really want it.",1,0,1,1,23,9,17,20,15.3333333333333,0.391304347826087,1.97628458498024,6,10,7

"I ventured over to the Verizon Wireless store on Sunday afternoon because I was eligible for the ""new every two"" deal that Verizon runs. I wanted to upgrade my phone and ask some questions about plans for smartphones because the Verizon wireless website wasn't very clear.

The store is very clean and laid out well with so many different phones on display that you can try out. There is an area to ""check-in"" when you enter the store. I didn't check in since when I got to the store, I was the only customer there; later when the store got busy, the check-in kiosk becomes important as it puts you in queue to be helped by a salesperson, customer service rep, or technician.

I was helped by Katie (I think that was her name) and she answered all of my and my husband's questions. She explained the plans very well and made it much easier to understand than how it was presented on the Verizon website. She was so polite and helpful and even set up my email on the Blackberry Curve so I wouldn't have to figure it out.

After my name was called, I went to ask the lady to look at my phone, only to discover that they DO NOT have anyone in technical services at that store, ever, which means that there is no one to help when customers are having issues with their current phone.

He said that the only way we could do that was by ordering them to be shipped to us and then coming in to the store to have them set them up for us.

"I have had numerous bad experiences at this Verizon Wireless store. I have been lied to by several employees about what I am being sold and will NEVER return here.   

Two prime examples:  

1) I was told that since I had a tablet and phone on the same account, I could add a home line and my bill could be ""bundled and reduced by about $20-30 a month"" so it was ""silly not to do this deal"". Well, I took the bait and ended up with an extra line I didn't need and actually INCREASED my bill by $20-30 a month instead of reduced it, like I was told. I tried to cancel after the first month and my bill was ridiculous however it was outside of the 14 day return policy and I had to pay an extra $150 to do so!!   

Well, silly silly me decided to go back since I needed a new phone and they are the closet store to me....... bad idea!!   

2) I just purchased a new phone 13 days ago from this store and they refuse to return in even though the phone clearly has internal issues and registers touches all over the screen at random given moments - making emailing business clients impossible since it sometimes sends messages or types things I didn't ask it to do. I found out today, which I was NOT told initially, that I also no longer have a warranty on this phone since it was purchased on a different line and switched to the one I primarily use (since I needed an upgrade and didn't have one).   

Mind you, I had to purchase a new phone because someone screwed up at the store and didn't put the insurance on my phone when I asked for it multiple times (I'm adamant about this because I have terrible luck with phones). If I had had insurance, I could have gotten my phone replaced. Since I didn't, I had to get this new phone that is also messed up. Which they will not return, even though they said I had 14 days for exchanges, per their policy.  

 I highly recommend anyone to STAY AWAY FROM VERIZON, ESPECIALLY THIS ONE!! THEY ARE LYING THIEVES!!",1,0,1,5,11,-9,-16,1,-8,-0.818181818181818,1.76363636363636,6,1,4
"Here's the drill: (1) Walk in. (2) Make sure someone signs you in. (3) Patiently wait for your name to be called. (4) Get whatever service you need.

Visit at your own risk. (3) Workers are people too. When you show up near closing time, they're bound to get irate. While there is no excuse for this, it doesn't help to add to the anger.

"Avoid Avoid Avoid!

Even if you live in Tempe, please drive the extra miles to your second closest Verizon location.

I came into the store with issues transferring contacts from one smartphone to another after I was having issues with Backup Assistant.  I went during an off-period so I did not experience a long wait like most reviewers did.  But, I spent TWO HOURS in the store while associates failed to perform a simple contact transfer from the Backup Assistant/Cloud storage onto my phone.  I ended up leaving with the promise that a ticket had been created and the issue would be resolved shortly thereafter.  But , here I sit hours later and STILL no contacts on my phone.

After two hours at home trying to figure it out and two hours in the store, I was very frustrated with my experience with Verizon and wanted to talk to the manager.  Carlos was a grade-A jerk and told me that backing up contacts was my responsibility, EVEN THOUGH I HAD CONTACTS ON MY OLD PHONE AND ON BACKUP ASSISTANT.  He said there was nothing he could do to help me since Backup Assistant is a free service, evidently ignoring the fact that I am a paying customer who just wasted half a day to not even get contacts put on my phone.

"I went in to this location about two months ago to upgrade my iPhone 5 to a 5s. I had been to other places getting quotes on how much they would give me for my old iPhone 5 in regards to trade in and Verizon was the highest at 300$ so I decide to upgrade with them. 

The salesman first tried to sell me on their new Verizon edge plan which is fine I know thats what he is supposed to do, I declined and he then seem uninterested to process my upgrade which led me to believe he wasn't going to make any commission. He then disappeared to the back and said he was getting my phone for me and didn't come back for like 5 minutes. When he finally did come back all he had me do was sign his iPad and then disappeared again into the back to ""activate"" the phone he said. After about 10 more minutes of waiting he comes back and now my new iPhone is out of the box and he is going through the setup screens! So much for getting to open my own phone up for the first time. (I was actually excited about that by the way) Anyways he then comes back and grabs my old phone, has me erase it and then I decide to ask him about commission. I asked if it was true that he gets less commission on iPhones then Android phones and he tells me that because I was doing a cross upgrade (using someone else's upgrade on my plan but applying it to my line) and then trading in my own phone that he wasn't going to get any commission! Then I understood the poor customer service! I was fine with this figured he just wanted to get me done as quickly as possible and help someone else he was actually going to make money on, no big deal..

Here we are now two months later and I notice on my bill that I have been getting charged a 5.00 navigation fee charge on my bill that was added onto my account the day that I upgraded! What a coincidence! I am sure that he added this plan to my bill to make some sort of commission on the sale.. I now had to be on hold with Verizon for 30 minutes to get this credited back to my account and removed permanently. 

It is just a shame that I can't even trust the Verizon Sales people at this location anymore...

I made the huge mistake of taking my phone to the river. I had a Galaxy S3 with a Bluetooth speaker I bought online, and which was waterproof unlike my phone. I put my phone in a couple Ziploc bags, which ended up being fruitless as the bags got water in them and my phone died. I put it in a bag of rice overnight but that didn't fix it. 

I pay for the damage protection plan so I called this store since they are closest and told them my situation. They instructed me to come in so they could take a look.

I arrived and per usual they were moderately busy. I put in my spot in line and waited about 15 minutes which wasn't a huge deal. After waiting one of the ""specialist"" came over and asked me for my name. Once he confirmed that I was who was waiting, he gave me a card and told me to call or go online with that. I asked him if I could do this in the store. He said no. I then asked why I was told to come in, he didn't know either.

Went in to upgrade my phone with a deal they had going on--that my husband had JUST used that same day in a different corporate store--and the service rep had no idea what I was talking about and told me that what I was asking could not be done. So then I asked to speak to a supervisor and the guy stalled and told me that the supervisors were all busy and couldn't talk to me. Tried to get my husband on the phone to explain the deal to the guy and he said, ""I never talk to people on the phone that I don't know and can't see."" Guess the guy must NEVER answer the phone at work then. At this point there were multiple (non-helpful) employees standing around and I was so upset I stated that I would never shop there again. Apparently no one cared that I walked out very upset. I drove straight to the Verizon store my husband had gone to (on Frye Rd by the Chandler mall) and they immediately signed me up with the same deal--no questions asked.

"Wow. I've been a Verizon customer for almost 11 years now and I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service I received today by a particular rep. I did not get his name unfortunately.

This is a newer location close to my home and I was excited to finally upgrade to a newer phone. However, I ultimately changed my mind on doing so at this store because of the sales rep I encountered. Perhaps I expect more bc I was a sales rep for 6 years and I can see thru the B-S, but I think most folks would have felt a similar level of annoyance based on the exchange.

This was an easy sale for him. A cake walk. I was about to spend whatever $ to upgrade my phone and all the necessary accessories including a car charger, phone case and screen cover because I was ready to do so. Of course I'm not aware of their commission structure, but it's fair to assume he would have made $ on the sale. 

Positives-Store was clean, new, and well set up. My mom worked with a pleasant, friendly sales rep the day prior so I know they do have good reps working there. 

Negatives-Rep I worked with today never attempted to inquire/learn about my need as a customer. That's sales 101 my friends. He was more interested in spouting out the bells and whistles about the droid than actually listening to his customer. I could care less about a super duper top of the line pimped out phone-I've been using my LG for years now without a front that works properly, but to me, a phone is just a phone and it was time to upgrade to a basic newer phone with the credit I had.

I asked several times for a comparison between the iphone 4 and the droid. He did give basic differences which I appreciated. I learned that you don't get to service your iphone at Verizon stores, you have to go to the apple store. That was a helpful piece of information. However, when I asked about accessories and details about a screen cover he stared at me blankly and sarcastically responded ""it's a screen cover."" He lost the sale there. Obviously I'm competent enough to know it's a screen cover, I was asking about other features it offered and the different ones available. He also wouldn't give my Mom and I space/time to review the info ourselves, he hovered the entire time.

Perhaps I just caught him on bad day, but I was taken aback by his approach, clear sales pitches and dis-ingenious nature. I will be going to a different location to upgrade, but I did not feel listened to or valued as a customer today with him.",1,0,0,4,25,15,24,25,21.3333333333333,0.6,2,5,11,9
"My husband and I went here at 7:30 on a Monday to upgrade my Droid X2 to a white Iphone 5. I knew I wanted that particular phone so I called earlier to see if they had any (which they did) and to find out what time they closed (9pm). 

I figured going to a stand-alone location in Ballantyne would be pretty easy, you know just walk in, grab the phone, and leave. 

That is what we did, we just had to wait over an hour to even be seen by anyone! I just thought the wait was ridiculous. After about 40 minutes we were offered a soda, but who wants that at 8:15 at night? We were then told we would be seen shortly. Shortly was 20 minutes later. 

I understand they had difficult customers who couldn't make up their mind and had to be talked through the phone buying process. But really? I hope we were an exception. 

The sales person who we finally did see was very nice, and he apologized for the wait. We had my new phone in hand and paid for in about half an hour. 

** Just a side note though because I have not had an upgrade in a couple of years, but does anyone else know about/think is crazy that Verizon now charges $30 to upgrade? Even if the phone is free you still get charged $30 on your next bill. I think it's stupid and plan on calling customer service to see if I can get this taken off.

The other agent who was handling my phone seemed very knowledgeable about the hardware he was paid to support. I knew he was not very tech savvy when he attempted to hard shutdown my phone only to trigger the photo snap.

"Don't shop here - GO TO A CORPORATE VERIZON STORE.

I had my worst retail experience in my entire life at this store.  I should say that again, I am not exaggerating: my worst retail experience in my entire life.

I agree with the previous review of this store on a parallel yelp entry for this store.  I dealt with Byron Huskins and he cancelled my order for iPhone 6 Plus phones without even telling me.  I only found out when I called to pickup my phones that although they had arrived I was not going to be allowed to leave the store with them.  The order wasn't really cancelled, the phones were there but Byron didn't want me ever getting them.

I elevated this issue to the manager (he manages several of these stores throughout Charlotte, he said ""you are not going to leave the store with these phones.""

The employees outright lie to you, you think they couldn't do that.  I was told if i didn't like it I should hire an attorney.  They dared me to sue them.  They have a devil may care attitude.

When someone acts with impunity and uses the cliche to sue them if you don't like it, you know you are in peril as a customer.

If you cancel your contract within 6 months of starting your order this store will charge you for the purchase price of your smartphone, you will still owe Verizon Wireless $350, but this store could charge you up to $800 more on top of that.  They also have higher prices on the phones than a corporate store so you if you cancel you will pay more than if you walked into a Verizon Wireless corporate store and outright bought a phone without a contract at full ticket.  If you order a phone from a Verizon Wireless corporate store you can get the phone for the subsidized price, cancel the contract the next day and only pay the $350.

These people are terrible and the deals are worse.  There are many more reasons to never shop here.  My experience was the worst and as a result I have hatred, that is a very strong emotion to get from trying to buy something.

"1pm...

Ok...had to edit my review. After visiting an official Verizon store, viewing the tablet we wanted and then finding out it was on backorder for at least two weeks we called Michael and took him up on his previous offer. An hour after we called, he had the tablet hand delivered to the store. That's impressive. Irene set up our account. She is very knowledgeable about the different phones available, as she was explaining different up-grade options available.  I still don't like the fake phones they have here, but in this instance we are very happy. The stars are for superior customer service.

Now I remember why I don't like the retailer stores. All of the phones on display were fake. You cannot try them out, you more or less have to guess how they will  work. There were no tablets on display, but Michael pulled out two for us to look at. Unfortunately, they were not what were looking for today. One was a Verizon brand , the other was an older model.

"The only reason I gave them 1 star was because you couldn't give NEGATIVE scores! I will NEVER shop here again. This is NOT a true Verizon store.  They're a FRANCHISE store that only purchases products from Verizon and re-sells them on Verizon's network. Their RULES and Verizon's TRUE stores have a different set of rules as far as returns and warranties go, etc...

Today I attempted to return a product that was sold to me under false pretenses. I have a Pacemaker/Defibrillator and purchased this product to use with my medical device, so they could check it remotely.  I don't think that it was done INTENTIONALLY, at least I HOPE it wasn't done intentionally, but  after today I'm starting to wonder.

This week I had an appt where I was told what I had purchased will not work with ANY medical devices. These devices transfer data (via the Fax theory) and these wireless home phone devices don't work like that. When I tried to return it., UNOPENED & UNUSED, the manager called 911 on me, AFTER I had agreed to ANY charges he had to charge me for taking back the product.  But I'm just not paying for something for 2 years that I not only don't really need, but that the product doesn't do what I NEED it to do. I don't know about you, but I can't afford to pay for something that is actually WORTHLESS to me.  He tried to intimidate me with all these re-stocking fees as well as his threats of my losing another discount, on something else etc... When that didn't work, he made the decision to call 911 on me for telling him ""Then he could KEEP the sonofabitch"". I said that immediately after he REFUSED to take it back and told me there's NOTHING he's going to do to help me. At that point I picked up the box, moved it to the other side of the counter... DROPPED the box... (it dropped hard but was NOT SLAMMED), when I said... ""You can keep the sonofabitch then!""  Let me also note that there was no one else in the store, just me., so I did not make a scene in front of any other customers.  Next thing I know he's telling  me to ""...leave the store or he'd call the cops"". Not being intimidated by a ""CELLPHONE SALESMAN"", I told.him I wasn't going anywhere until I get this handled. (I was also on hold with ""Verizon Customer Service"" at the time, who had previously TOLD me (20 mins earlier) to take it back to the store and if I had ANY problems returning it to call them from the store where they could speak to the manager) In the meantime the manager (Zach) decides to CALL 911 and in about 5 minutes, 3-5 cops show up, while I'm still on hold sitting in a chair not saying a word! The cops walk in and ask him what the problem was, and he tells them I was throwing stuff around and cursing at him. When I chimed in to the cop and said... ""I'm a real problem over here huh?  ONE of the 5 of the ""Doughnut Brigade"", decided he was going to try to GOAD me into something so he could cuff me. I didn't fall for his trap, so the hairlip didn't get his satisfaction

But the bottom line on this issue is that this manager didn't want to deal with the problem and due to his LACK of ""Customer Service"" skills, he called the Police on a customer who had been with Verizon less than 30 days, with 3 OTHER devices connected to my account. So, for a couple of bucks, he chose to piss off a BRAND NEW CUSTOMER, that very easily could've LEFT Verizon cuz AT&T, T-mobile and Sprint are ALL paying early termination fees. AT&T's begging me to come back.

VERIZON corporate itself was GREAT! They ended up working with me and decided it was better to make a customer happy over a couple dollars than it was to call the COPS on him. VERIZON itself is WONDERFUL and took care of the problem IMMEDIATELY. Even they were appalled at this guy calling the cops. I will continue to be a Verizon Customer...

"We went in to sign a Verizon contract in order to get a new phone (the same style but just a new one). The phones here are less expensive than going to an actual Verizon store or ordering through Verizon on line. This makes it worth going here. We paid $50, but will get it back through a rebate. The same phone at Verizon would have been $100 minus the $50 rebate, making it a $50 out of pocket cost!

However, the first time I went in, the woman made it very clear to me that the style of phone I was choosing would require no money down at all and no rebate to process. The next day when she was gone, the story changed.

Also, we had no idea we were dealing with a store that is not really a Verizon store, since the words ""Go Wireless"" are not predominant in their signage. So there are TWO contracts that you sign - one with Go Wireless and one with Verizon! 

We didn't realize this until we got home, because when you sign the contract electronically, it is not even printed so you can read it! When we got home and looked through the paperwork, we were very nervous about what we had signed.

When my husband read that there will be a $30 upgrade fee which will appear on our Verizon bill, he blew a gasket, since the salesman hadn't mentioned this. He called to talk to  the manager who convinced him that that is a charge from Verizon which applies to every one of their customers. I did verify that through Verizon customer service.

My advice to other customers: Take heed, the sales people are fuzzy  about the fees and rebate information which will affect you. Ask for a printout of the contract before you sign so you can ask about all that the salesman forgot to tell you. If you are willing to go through this extra diligence, I think you will save enough money that it will be worth it.",3,0,0,1,17,3,4,17,8,0.176470588235294,1.27941176470588,3,3,11

The salesman really took his time walking me through the options of both phones and helped me make the decision easy to move to the new Galaxy note. 

He also helped me find a great deal on a tablet for my son for Christmas!

Finally he looked at my plan and told me I could save money moving to a different package for my data and got me additional gig of data to my plan for less!

Well for starters they WANT to help their customers, they don't want to suck every penny out of them...and I'm sure they're much nicer. I've let Verizon rip me off for way too long. 

I didn't get the reps name, but he refused to turn off my phone just told me to go to virgin tomorrow and my contract will end then. But I specifically asked him to turn it off but he wouldn't. Wouldn't let me make the last payment.

"Although 2013 has not officially ended yet, I think it is safe to assume I can issue out my award for the crappiest transaction I have made of the year. Go Wireless, you not only made the cut, you exceeded every expectation of what a retail store should NOT do.

This place looks like a Verizon store. I didn't even know it wasn't a Verizon store until halfway through my transaction. No big deal. Was even told that there was a 30 dollar charge Verizon has for dealing with this store. O.K., whatever.

I pay for the phone, renew the contract for 2 years and pay the 30 dollar fee. I am told that with the plan I am changing to I will save over 10 bucks a month.  Outstanding, unfortunately not true.

Fast forward. After I get home a day or so later I try to call people I know. Numbers are no longer on my new phone. I also have contacts on there from 3 phones ago.  One guy on my contact list had been dead for over 5 years. I look over the bill. I paid 20 bucks to have my contacts moved over. Obviously a fail.
I bring the phone back to the store, tell them the situation. Guy I bought the phone from hooks my old phone back up to the new one again. Says I am good to go.  Every contact is listed again for the last 3 phones I had. Says there is nothing he can do about that, and just to delete the old numbers. Again, I paid 20 bucks for this honor.

I get my Verizon bill shortly after. I am charged 30 bucks. I call Verizon, they say no, you pay us 30 bucks for going through them, and they charges you 30 dollars for their own fee.  Now at 60 bucks. Smoke and mirrors. Sure I get it. I figure the hell with it, they got me, keep the money, you won.

Normally I would have let it go, never done business with them again. So, that 10 dollars a month I was supposed to save (by the way did not happen, bill was still the same) however I notice my debit card is being charged 7 bucks a month. So, in addition to paying the same amount on the monthly bill, I am now paying extra for the insurance. 10 bucks a month not saving, plus 7 bucks extra for insurance, $408.00 extra over two years.  If that doesn't sound like a lot, send me a check for $408.00.

Funny thing is, I never gave them my debit card to give the insurance company, nor do I ever authorize automatic deductions from my account. When I asked go wireless about this, no one could ever produce a document where I authorized a third party to start billing me.  

So, it gets worse. I call go wireless on the number on my invoice.  no one calls me back. I go down to the store, told I can only talk to the manager I bought the phone from.  Apparently the employees in the store cannot do anything about it.  Went in twice when the manager was supposed to be in. He wasn't.  Finally, after several messages, I actually get him on the phone.  He says the store just opened up (even though it was an hour past when the website says they open) and he doesn't have a computer on. I tell him I can wait. He says he will call me back in a half hour. He doesn't. I call back later that day, leaving a few messages telling the manager specifically to call me back. Phone never rang back.

I call back 3 separate days and leave messages. Guess what, phone never rang back.

I go back into the store, of course the only soul who can apparently help me is a fucking ghost.  I tell the kid working the counter my dilemma, DO NOT CHARGE MY DEBIT CARD EVERY MONTH, why the hell is this happening?  Can you provide me a document where I authorized a third party who I have no idea who they are to have access to my bank info and charge me every month? He hands me a brochure with their phone insurance companies info and apologizes that I did not receive that when I bought my phone and was not informed that I would be charged every month separate from my Verizon bill. I wonder if I am supposed to wipe my ass with it because I don't care at this point, I am pissed off I was never told.  I leave a message with the kid working the counter to have the manager, the only person who can do anything about this, to call me A.S.A.F.P. the next day.  he said he would be there in the morning and would make sure he called me tomorrow. No call was made to me.

Finally, a week later I get this fucking guy on the phone. He instantly knows who I am because he has black belt skills in dodging any sort of effort to even talk to me.  Tells me he worked it out and and my debit card will not be charged anymore for the insurance on the phone. I ask him twice after that ""Are you sure?"" He said yes. Nope, statement next month billed me for the insurance. Thanks dick hole.

See, here is the deal guy. If you are an asshole, rip me off, sell me something that sucks, I can generally deal with that. However, you lied to me. Several times.  When you lie to someone, especially a customer, you are saying ""Your stupid."" The hell with this store, hope to God this place is out of business soon. Don't be stupid do NOT go here.

"First, i didn't know until later this is not a real ""Verizon Wireless"" store. This explains a lot of the headache I went through. Multiple ""bogus"" fees rolled into my final transaction. My $100 phone which came out to $127 (and before that price they said it was $175 but after an hour of them removing BS fees it came down to 127) was a little confusing to me because how does a $100 transaction come out to $127 and when I asked why she said it was taxes. It wasn't until I was half way home that i thought ""taxes in Arizona are not 27%, hell not anywhere"". When I looked, it was another fee of 20 called ""READY 2 GO DEVICE SET UP"". This store is an absolute waste of time. I did not describe all of the highlights that made my visit frustrating as hell mainly because I don't have the time or space to type it all out for you. Everyone knows you will pay a lot for a ""free"" phone but this was different circumstances. The phone wasn't for me. I already had a new S4 but never used my upgrade. I can't believe they can setup a shop and trick customers into thinking it's a legit Verizon store. The experience was sooo bad that when I told her I saw the phone online for ""free"" she told me I must I have read it wrong.  ""Why couldn't she see the same phone Verizon wireless offered for free?"" I literally had to leave the store, go back to work, do a ""print screen"" on the web pages I was able to see and then bring them back to the ""go"" version store to prove it was free. I'm sure this is because they are NOT a legit store but a  store owned by ""Joe Shmo"" that sells Verizon products.

Update, ""I thought this nightmare was over"": my mail in rebate came in but only for half. My $100 rebate showed up as a $50 rebate. I called the ""go Verizon""  where my nightmare of a transaction took place and they were unable to help me unless a came in. So i went back  ""again"" to the store and they printed off the transaction confirming it was for $100. My options were to resend all of the information back and call citi card to dispute and fix the error. Its amazing how this error is my problem. I was soo pissed i called Verizon and basically said if this error is not fixed over the phone i will be taking the 5 lines i pay for a month and move to t-mobile asap. After being on the phone for 1 hour it was resolved and they said a new card with $100 will be sent out on 9-4-2014 which is weird because today is 09-09-2014 (I just realized that as i was typing) ""oh dear god"" lets just hope i can get what is owed to me without any more headaches.

"I am writing a review about the Cell Helmet Repair crew. They are pretty awful. I went to them because of convenience (close to my work place) and because they had a screen available immediately for my broken phone. 

Sigh.. so I went to the store and got my screen ""repaired."" Within an hour, my screen malfunctioned, so I had no working phone. They supposedly ""fixed"" that, but unfortunately, they fixed my phone in a way so that I could make no outgoing phone calls. Subsequently, I was able to make outgoing phone calls, but unable to check any voicemail.

The gist of the story is that when I took my phone to Cell Helmet to get it fixed, I kept leaving with new phone problems that I did not have previously. I had to make multiple trips to get my phone fixed. The people that they have there to do cell phone repair are very inexperienced and clearly not good at what they do. I would never go back again to get my phone fixed there, and I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone.",1,0,0,0,11,1,-3,2,0,0.0909090909090909,0.890909090909091,3,3,5
"Verizon has become with the new iPhone a real compeitor to AT&T.  

The cellphones are slightly different ( you cannot use the internet while talking), but Verizon seems to be the better choice.  The folks who work here are very nice and friendly and more than willing to help you switch over.

I only showed up at this store thinking I could get some actual service. This after several long waits on the phone to Verizon to no avail.

"I went in to use my upgrade for my iPhone4s to just get the same exact phone because I am perfectly content with this specific model, making the final purchase of my new phone $0.00. ""Awesome!"" I thought. When I looked at my bill for February (just to mentally prepare and affirm the quota like very other month), it said I owed $101.70, when I usually owe $46.03. Because I purchased  $10 insurance, I expected my bill to be approximately $56.03. My thoughts, ""Holy crap! What?"" I spent 40 minutes on the phone with Verizon asking why my bill was so high and they explained to me that when you upgrade a phone, you are charged a $30.00 service fee. I accepted this, but the fact that the sales associate, Levy, did not express this to me, it worried me and wasted time on the phone I honestly did not have. A representative of Verizon connected herself and I, and Levy from this location, on a 3-way call so that we can ask exactly why my bill is so high, and he was very rude to me. I do not recommend going to this location if you are a shopper looking for excellent customer service. Although I affirmed with Levy that there will not be any additional charges, it was clearly not true.

Advice for future phone shoppers: Ask about service fees when upgrading phones! ...and of course, additional charges before spending any money.

I interacted with a few different employees and was impresses with all of them. Vernon C. Does deserve a special mentioned as he assisted me with a company cell phone and my companies horrible policies on transferring data to a new phone. For the management staff: Vernon deserves a raise/promotion we put him through torture and he kept his composure and professionalism the entire time.

"I wish I had read these reviews and talked to Vernon instead of Nathan. Nathan promised to help me move my ITunes to my new Galaxy. The ITunes were only on the phone I traded in, so when he sent me home to transfer the data myself over some program he sent me (that stupid program downloaded a bunch of crap on to my desktop,) it was all lost. That wasn't entirely his fault.  I can suck that up and spend a week downloading all my cd's again, but Nathan refuses to return phone calls and emails. To add insult to injury, when I went back to retrieve the $80.00 case that I left on my trade-in phone, it was gone. Thanks, Nathan.",1,0,0,0,7,-7,-9,-9,-8.33333333333333,-1,2,4,1,2
