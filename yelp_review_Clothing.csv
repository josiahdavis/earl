Today, however, I needed to purchase an outfit for an interview and felt I would have the most luck here. I was correct. I found a nice blouse for $14, tights for $7, and killer pumps for $30 (my splurge of the day) for the occasion. Besides finishing my interview attire, I found a cute zebra-print romper for $4 dollars. Yes you heard me correctly, FOUR DOLLARS. I also found an adorable tank top for another outrageous $2. Head in there this weekend, they are having a killer Labor Day sale and it's totally worth it. Oh and on top of that the employees were super friendly AND there is a Sephora inside. I never thought I'd say this but I might shop at this JCPenney again.","review","IO3AsR6cdMto7VCwfPzf2w",2,1,2,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

I was a little apprehensive about going into a department store for a haircut, but the staff was professional and the prices were excellent. 

But the most positive aspect of my visit was how accommodating they were. If you're a hijabi this location can accommodate your request for privacy. I asked the woman on the phone and she was able to arrange it with my stylist. My stylist was extremely nice and didn't seem to mind cutting my hair in the waxing room. 

She also did a fantastic job of fixing my hair after a bad haircut I got elsewhere. They also sent me home with a few coupons for my next visit. 


I plan on going here again!","review","B0vAkXiMO4FJV2sM6tFGDw",0,0,0,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

So I called JCPenny Portrait Studios a couple days ago to see if they would allow me to take my dog Roscoe to the studio to get our picture taken together. These pictures were very important to me because he is turning 12 in December and our time is limited if you know what I mean. 

Anyways so I called them on Saturday and they scheduled me an appointment on Monday (tonight) night which was super quick for such late noticed. So there I went, I walked my 60lb dog all the way through JCPenny (because the portrait studio was in the back) and not one employee was a brat about it. They all greeted him warmly and pointed me in the right direction. 

The woman who took our picture was named Erica and she was amazing. So patient with Roscoe and had some great ideas. The pictures came out absolutely fabulous and I am SO excited to get my prints. I was on a budget and she didn't push me to buy a ton at all, it was pressure free. I wanted a CD but it was so expensive she even showed me a cheaper alternative, ($10 to put them online for 2 years) instead of trying to convince me to buy a CD. 

The prices are ridiculously reasonable. Regular prints cost $4/sheet and special effects prints start at $10. Really, you can't beat prints at $4/sheet... 

All in all I am very impressed and so excited for these prints (I'll put pictures up when they go online!) 
One tip: Don't go in without a coupon...go online to their website jcpportraits and print them out! I got a coupon for one free sitting (a sitting is $9/person so since there was two of us it only cost $9) along with a two pose package which included 1 8X10, 2 5X7's and eight wallets. 

If you're hesitant on JCPenny Portrait Studios, or want to bring a pet in I definitely reccommend doing so!!","review","DfVhEfh6KUxHrDbs57zYGg",0,0,0,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

"-_LReJW6VV2RBIPS_TaZWQ","2014-08-08","tIEj7f7iQboU0kzcUUrpAQ",3,"Man this place is overpriced. They send out coupons almost weekly. Usually for $10 off $25 and some online coupons. Really nothing that special, and it still doesn't knock the prices down to what you can get at Kohl's. Also, since their fall from grace a few years ago, their big and tall section royally sucks. They stopped carrying St. John's Bay standard colored pocket t-shirts and instead sell their own crappy JCP line which only feature SUPER bright colors. This may seem like a trivial compliant, but the $10 big and tall shirts in earthy tones (and some brighter ones) is what really drew us here for a long time. Now there's either JCP bright colors, or the option to dress like a gangster if you are a male over 6'4 and shopping here. 

Also, I hate the ""boutique"" layout for women. It takes forever to shop and match clothes between brands. Smart strategy, I get it. But when your clothes are not that cute and overpriced, it doesn't entice me. 

Also I signed up for their JCP rewards. If you spend $100 in one month you get a $10 off coupon for the following month. Even though I will NEVER hit that mark, it still irritated me that an employee could not find my reward account in their system so a hefty purchase (a nice pillow) would count toward it. Yet she could still find some of my information. Not sure if it was her incompetence, or that she kept saying the system was messed up and freezes on them a lot. Either way its something they need to fix. When I went to pick up the pillow, another associate that helped me gave me the number of the rewards program to call so I can sort it out with them. Their system couldn't see how close I was to earning the coupon. Seems like a crappy set up to me for the nice make over the place has.","review","UPlbzzIvlbU6CQr55uMzSw",0,0,0,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

I found shorts and tops for $2.99 a pair! Both men and women! It was shocking and I was in a shopping coma. Bed sheets? No prob - $19 for queen sheets. Earrings - yeah, $2. 

Since I hadn't been in the store for a while, I noticed they are doing a lot of upgrades. Cash registers at every corner and fancy touch screens. Even the employees carry around iPods (or some version) and use that to ring purchases up. It was so tech savvy. They were even working on adding a Sephora beauty area.

We browsed around a bit and I stopped into the bathroom and unfortunately left my phone in there - which I noticed not even five minutes after I left it.  I asked every worker I could find on the second floor if a phone had been turned in and received mostly the same reaction from each - ""Nothing was turned into me"" and they would walk off.  Not super helpful and no attempt to call other register bases or the office or LP to see if it was turned in anywhere else.

So, eventually I was able to find my fiancee and we walked to a register downstairs which was had an employee that was nice enough to point us to the management office and they had my phone turned in by one of their employees. This probably would have been a much quicker find if the personnel upstairs had made a simple phone call down to the office - but all in all my phone was there and turned in so I can't be too frustrated by the situation.

Once the fiasco was over, we were able to return to shopping, and we found some really great clearance deals in the baby / children section for both our nieces and stocked up on clothes for the holidays on the cheap!  Got about 15 pieces of clearance summer clothing for $27 - can't beat that pricing!

This is beyond the WORST service I have ever received in my life. I have been to many portrait studios over the years for Xmas photos, my child's yearly photos, family photos,etc. Never have I ever been so disappointed in my life. 

First off, my appointment was scheduled at 12:20 pm. Not only did I arrive 20 minutes beforehand, but the studio was packed and I was told they were 20 minutes behind schedule. Well guess what, you were an hour behind!!! There were at least 4 groups of people ahead of me and you have only 2 photographers
. 
Second of all, when I patiently waited to have my pictures finally taken, the photographer breezed through it. I had to ask her twice to look at some of the photos and guess what my child's eyes were FUCKING closed. Seriously? You're job is a photographer - she's 6. She's not screaming in your face and she smiles on cue. Why the FUCK can't you make sure she's looking directly at you and her eyes are not shut? Plus, the photographer spent like what? 10 minutes during our session because yes, I know you guys are behind, but wow I'm paying for photos that are going to my family, so have some respect and give me some common courtesy. Unlike the two other moms before me that told you people off I was actually patient sitting there with my child not creating a fuss at the studio. Guess that doesn't work!!! (By the way, those 2 moms didn't even get good photos either).
 
Third of all, when I was done with my session, guess what. No one showed me my pictures. I saw the computers opened and found my name and found, I don't know, maybe 1 out of the 3 pictures I thought was okay. It wasn't even great because if you look through our album, my daughter's eyes were either closed or she wasn't even looking at the camera. And when I was finally done then someone comes over ""Oh no, no one helped you?"" Yeah no shit. And then you try to sell me on more products? My photos are already like shit, why the fuck would I get my Xmas cards from you?!?! I don't even know if I want to use them on my card. I might just go to the park and have a random stranger take a picture of my daughter and I and it would look better than the photos you guys took. 
Needless to say, you guys need to spread out your appointments more. 20 minutes in between sessions with 2 photographers on a week before Thanksgiving? The company should know better. And oh yeah, you guys ALSO ran out of photo CDs so I have to come back in a week to even get my digital images. Thanks a lot!

I would be more pissed off if I paid regular price for this session at all. Luckily I got the $25 JCPenney photo Groupon like most of the moms did and one of the employees actually said that was worth $150?! Haha. Seriously? I just took professional family photos with my daughter for $300 and I had a photographer and assistant for a whole hour with three outfit changes. I will never go here or recommend this place to anyone. In fact, I Yelp on a daily basis and you will be seeing my review up for this store.

I interrupted a couple of chatting teenaged sales clerks to find out that Menswear was upstairs. When I located the escalator it was fenced off and out of order so I had to find either the stairs or the elevator. I found out later that the escalator had already been out of order for a couple of weeks! 

The sales guy that attempted to help me was very sweet but he must come to work on a short bus. I told him the style I needed - a 36 waist and 34 inseam. He must have brought me about 6 different pairs , none of which were 36-34. I literally had to ask him if he knew that 38 was not the same as 36!  I finally found the proper pair myself, and they were on sale, so Penney's earned a purchase and a 2nd star.

It's supposedly one of their so-called ""concept stores"", which led me to believe it was going to be huge and fabulous. Very exciting, and I have already been twice: once on opening night (free cheap champagne and fabulous people watching, like all of Scottsdale's bad plastic surgery in one place) and once this morning.

This store's layout is supposed to be modeled after one's own closet, which is laughable because if my own closet looked like that I wouldn't be shopping at BR. It's a bunch of little rooms based on ""looks"" - work, casual, etc. That's OK, I guess, but it makes the whole shopping experience somewhat disjointed. I was hoping that they would be carrying a bigger variety of items, but if anything, it's even less than the old store - kind of a bummer. 

It was nice to see that the store was well stocked, and that even after opening day hubbub in our anorexic town, there were smalls and extra-smalls in everything that I wanted to try on. The staff is extremely helpful and responsive, despite the chaos. The fitting rooms are huge, beautifully decorated, and very flatteringly lit. They had wicked deals this weekend - get a $25 card for every $100 you spend - that's pretty good. 

So yeah... big brouhaha for the new store, but really? It wasn't worth the press and the free hooch, but it will be always be a must-go at SFS.","review","UoBfwbXaixelZBghbJ2cSg",3,0,3,"Banana Republic","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

The design of the store is killer. ""Rooms"" of certain styles are one of the best ideas I've ever seen in retail. It was like shopping in a huge closet. Awesome. That warrants two stars in itself. 

What was NOT awesome were the plethora of bored employees judging people's outfits and disregarding anyone who wasn't wearing all BR. I felt the superficiality of the store was unappealing. The prices were also not parallel to the prices asked in other BR stores or online, but that's probably just the markups you get from having the luxury of renting a space at Fashion Square.

I liked how the store had a very upscale, contemporary vibe, but it felt a bit like a rabbit's warren with so many rooms branching off the main hallway. The idea of having different style vignettes in each room is great for people who like to buy whatever the mannequin is sporting, but I feel it makes it harder to mix and match to put your own outfits together. Also, the rooms seemed overcrowded and rather sterile. 

Big demerits for a tiny petites section--or maybe it was just because everything was crammed together in a small room that it felt like there were fewer items.

The jewelry and accessories room in the center of the store scored points with me, though. The jewelry selection was one of the largest I've seen in a BR.

If anyone is in this store - ask for Vincent. He's an amazing help and can find clothes to fit your body the right way. He used to help me at Ann Taylor in the Biltmore and I'm happy he has transitioned to this store.

I used to go to the Fashion Square BR all the time when I lived in Phoenix and I generally liked it.  I've been to this new store 4 times now when I've been back in town, and I just can't figure out how this was supposed to be an improvement.  The store layout is horrible -- with everything in tiny rooms I tend to just glance into a room, not see anything I like, and move on to the next room.  If I do see something I like, I then have to dig in 12 different places to find my size because they scatter the same product in numerous areas in the same tiny room.  

The employees seem especially foul here -- they brush right past you on their way through the store without even looking at you.  The ""mandatory greeter"" they make stand at the front of the store serves no purpose other than (1) to make me feel awkward when I want to look at the product in the front and (2) serve as the social gathering spot for other employees while they ignore me digging through stacks of pants looking for my size.

Given that this is a new wing of the mall and they likely had some say in what kind of space they ended up in, I just can't fathom why they chose this awkward layout.","review","NVJj1a__VmEhKwRc8LiWSA",0,0,0,"Banana Republic","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

After a short time on hold she came back to say yes, the pants in my size and the color I wanted were there. She put them on hold for me until closing the next night.

American Apparel has pretty much any type of colorful cotton clothing you can imagine. From tights, to tanks, to dresses, to shorts, to leotards...you name it's the Apparel's got it. It's a one stop shop for anything from costume needs to your daily colorful cotton needs. If my budget wouldn't slap me on the hand, I'd shop there more. But, when I need something and can't find it anywhere else, American Apparel normally has it. 

If it was less expensive, I'd give it four stars, but since it's only for the budget privileged, I give it a three.","review","4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ",2,2,5,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

There are a couple exceptions: the basic u-neck tanks, v-neck tees and headbands. However, I can find better quality (and less expensive) garments at Target.

Let's start with the clothing. As a pretentious somewhat obese man, I wear black v-necks like it's no one's business. Why? Because black is slimming, and v-necks make it look like I actually have a neck instead of a thick stree stump holding up my bowling ball shaped head.

American Apparel has managed to mess that up by ill-fitting shirts. The v-necks are too deep, and these are the regular cuts, not the ""deep v-necks"" which would probably show my sucked in navel.

Then, when I was said retarded looking shirt, it shrivels up like a nervous man at a cold beach. Not so great.

Maybe this style works for people with a more flattering physique than myself...maybe I need to hit the treadmill a little harder than I already do.

But for now, I have to say.... ""Eeks, methinks not.""

Now...onto the store.

The staff are pretentious rail-thin models who look like they are jealous of my eating skills. Or appalled by them. They seemed to be alarmed when I asked for a t-shirt in an XL. Yes Ladies, some of us actually wear a t-shirt in giant sizes. 

I should scare the bajobe out of them and show em a pic of me from a few years ago -- I was almost 100 lbs heavier. They'd probably quit and join The Biggest Gainer.

I'm sure the staff meant well, so I have em an extra star for that.

Not sure if I'd come back though.","review","8JC-Yb3UDUv2FUl5ym1nVg",0,1,1,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.

To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done. 

The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing. 

The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.

This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains.","review","5jODkdonMV0HbIIPik1RuA",2,0,1,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

It made me feel very uncomfortable and if I was ever going to steal any thing from that store it would have been the nail polish which was located at the register. There really is nothing in here I couldn't live without but I did find a really cute cardigan for my nephew. The employees were pleasant while they were checking me out but the whole time the security guard stood by the register watching but not watching (if that makes sense). Really ackward!

My second visit (same day but later) was to exchange the cardigan I bought for my nephew for a bigger size. There was the same security guard standing around and only one worker who told me she was a new employee. I let her know I just needed to exchange the cardigan for a bigger size and she told me that she couldn't do exchanges or returns and I would have to wait for the store manager to get back from her lunch. I asked how long and she said about 15 more minutes. So I went back out to my car and sat for 20 minutes just so I could exchange this cardigan! I was upset that I had to wait so long just to do an exchange when I bought the cardigan earlier in the morning. Although the store manager was polite when doing the exchange, she never apoligized for making me wait around for 20 minutes.

How can you leave an employee on their own when they do not know or have any authority to do exchanges or returns?!

I picked up my first edition of Post Secret here, among other now popular coffee table books. If you enjoy candles and kitchenware, they also have a nice array. Here is my one piece of advice: The same company owns Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, so before you omit to a piece, check and see if it is offered at a lower price at Urban. I have found a few things on sale there and regular price at Anthropologie, but it is rare. If you do decide to stop in, make sure you have some time (and some dough) to spend, because it could take all afternoon to browse!","review","fVW3PI77Tm0_JipZ49BWqg",0,2,1,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

We waltzed in here after exiting the Green Valley Ranch casino and since I wasn't much in the mood to shop for clothes, I thought I'd check out the kickin' sale of home items they had goin' on.  I was so not disappointed!  I ended up walking out with a cool, multi-colored decanter and a small oval mirror with silver duck feet at a stand (odd I know but really neat! lol).

however, since the District location is always so close and I have a coworker who loves anthropologie and is always talking about the sales, I have become rather clever at finding good sale items.  I have always been a bargain shopper (I love the hunt) and get a lot of thrill out of finding cool stuff at Marshall's for cheap.  yet recently I have purchased some really amazingly pretty and unusual pieces strictly on sale at anth.

today is no exception - I have learned to check the web site for what goes on sale, then hurry to the store to grab the last in my size or whatever.  today the sale in the back of the store had the dress I was looking for in my size (last one on rack) and another dress worth trying, both 50% off.  I had tried the grey one on when it was crazily expensive and couldn't justify it, but now it still looks good and costs half as much.  The blue dress was something different for me, but it is going to be a lot of fun to wear, and muuuuch cheaper than any full price dress in that store will ever be at the lowest price point.  the service is always really great too both in the dressing room and at the register.","review","bCLFdVfkAiZ7t1xDskb66Q",1,0,1,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

"1M7ScVRCiUYJVqjDbBx5pQ","2011-03-18","eFAfEhR5KGr4OSJ_IWpUjg",4,"It's true: Anthropologie is mind-shatteringly expensive. (It is most certainly out of my spending bracket yet I continue to spend there anyway because I just can't stay away.) Now that this is out of the way, we can move on to the important things like how this shop offers a variety of quality-made pieces, accessories, homewares, and books that are for the most part unique to the store and will give the same unique edge to your wardrobe, house or book collection.

I think the best way to describe Anthro's clothing selection is bohemian chic. Think Kate Hudson and Michelle Williams. During the winter there's a good selection of chunky, homemade-looking (for the most part in a good way) sweaters and during the summer lots of playful dresses in whatever colors or prints are in season or in-style. They do have business and business casual dresses and separates most of which run in the $80-$150 range as well as dresses that are bridal shower/wedding appropriate that run in the same range. Their jewelry selection borders on funky which really isn't my style but I did find a great pair of earrings for less than $30 that I'm totally in love with. Everything piece I've bought from Anthro has garnered compliments and I've always been happy with anything I bought because you get what you pay for and it lasts. 

What keeps me coming back though is the housewares. They have a revolving door of cute plates, mugs, serveware, measuring spoons, etc. that will give a creative and almost lived-in feel to a new space. My mom calls their selection ""flea market chic"" because all of the pieces are so unique, for the most part handmade without the worn three-other-people-owned-this-before-me look. They also have the most intoxicating candles ever made that will make you think twice about biting into them. My favorite is vanilla fig and candles will run you between $15-30 depending on size. They also have a fun selection of cookbooks, books, and stationery. 

If you truly can't get over the prices, then try Anthro during a sale. Remember, sale prices are relative and will still be on the high end, however you may be able to find something in your price bracket. Good things come to those who wait and there's nothing like seeing the giant ""SALE"" tapestry in their window. Generally, anything on sale or clearance is in a small room in the back left side of the store near the employee room.

Another thing that I like about Anthropologie is their in-store music. Yes, I'm that weirdo, who stops everything they're doing to take out her phone, open up my Shazam app and find a speaker to stand under to capture the song that's playing so I can go home and download the song. Yes, their music selection affects my review. In a positive way obviously. 

Overall this is a great shop with beautiful things and at worst you'll have a nice time window shopping and at best you'll find something that will last you forever.","review","KCQUgDM3vNuB5xn4ZXVo-A",2,0,2,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

It turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost. This meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes - they were theirs! Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties, which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift. I don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us find.

Everyone looked great, and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit, shirt, and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux. And I've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of town.

Jack has continued to be a great resource, alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding. I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts, mainly because I travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that BB offers (I HATE ironing shirts). But Jack introduced me to lines that Men's Wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers. Though a bit pricey at about $85-95/shirt normally, Men's Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47.

I can't speak about anyone other than Jack (he seems to always be there!), but I can't recommend him or this store highly enough.

We unluckily got helped by Morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming July. From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.

So let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.

Wow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying ""Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad"" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.

So, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.

And what's a cake without icing? Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands.

Went in on a Sunday at around 8 PM just perusing for some clothes with a girlfriend. I absolutely love how this particular store is laid out. Cute knick-knacks and kitschy books downstairs, then hop a couple flights of stairs (with massive windows overlooking the Strip, no less) with various clothes and accessories to tempt you on the way, then BAM!: gigantic floor full of clothes for both genders, a generous clearance section, fitting rooms, and even more books for the hipster in all of us. My friend and I found a couple things to try on with no avail, but the fitting room attendant did not seem to mind the extra work we were piling up on her just a couple hours before closing. I ended up just getting one cookbook from the clearance section ($15 off, a total score!) and the checkout was decent as I was the only person in line. I'm pretty sure I cockblocked the guy who was flirting with the girl at the cash register, but this book needed to be bought so my friend and I could make it to Firefly before we passed out from lack of lentils. 

Overall I love the layout of the store, the book section definitely gives me good fodder for my Amazon wishlist, and the clearance section does yield some good finds. The view on your walk up is also spectacular and would be great for people-watching. This is a wonderful store to lose track of time in and come out with something you will love, even if your wallet cringes.","review","6d6PyGPyiw_mAcA030Cyng",3,3,3,"Urban Outfitters","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Home & Garden,Men's Clothing,Women's Clothing","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

The PH is my favorite strip mall to shop, because it can actually BE SHOPPED by the average college student/traveler. But besides that, this UO, I could imagine, gets hit pretty hard due to its visibility from the strip side.
The selection is a bit strewn about, and because there are 2.5 floors (i don't count that middle area aka 2nd floor an actual floor)  it may be a little inconvenient to go from floor to floor when you're looking for something, but that's okay if you've got time on your hands (and your legs aren't yet tired from walking the strip). As far as the sales, this place has got the same sized sale section as the Mandalay Bay's, but I simply hate that they put clothes so high up that you can't reach, and have to HUNT for a sales associate to help you get something down that you may OR MAY NOT like once you see it full-front.

Since we go to this one more (it's more accessible- we go to the Miracle Mile shops more frequently- if you're coming from outside on the Strip, this is the 1st store you will see), it's safe to say that we shop here the most, out of the two stores- duh. I didn't realize until a few minutes ago, that I didn't do a review on this store yet. 

It's different levels of shopping (yup, merchandise- mostly women's clothing- is on the stairs and such) but most of the novelties (including gadgets) and books are located on the ground floor along with seasonal items (ornaments, gifts, etc.). The clothing (women's and men's) is mainly located on the upper level, along with shoes, bags, jewelry & accessories like hats and belts, more books, more novelties, dressing rooms, and sales racks in the far back right- sometimes this area is pretty messy to say the least (womens/books/novelties). Sometimes I find clothing, but please note, that the clothing sizes are smaller here (like junior size fitting)- like if you wear a medium normally, your size here would be a large. Cash registers are located on both levels for your convenience. 

We were here last night and holiday items were already marked 75% off! The regular prices are a bit high, so I always check out the markdowns. Like I said, check out the back far right for sales. 

Hipsters, Alternative types, and Asians are the majority customer base here. It is fun shopping here. Lots of unique gifts for people on your list.

I have my basics, and now it is time to supplement my closet with more quirky items or pieces that I would not normally add. The fact that they are discounted makes it easy to justify adding a color you would not normally wear and test the water. Seeing their clearance rack, I was initially disappointed.

In multiple visits I have come across rude salespeople but I shrugged it off. My most recent visit, however, has my mind set on never shopping at this store again. I had purchased a tshirt from the store and within 2 wears it had a hole. I took it back to the store and asked to exchange it. I was told without tags I couldn't do this. Having spent $35 on a tshirt I expect it to hold up and told the manager this. She told me repeatedly that she couldn't accept a return. She finally agreed to give me a store credit. She was rude throughout the exchange, interrupting me and making it clear she didn't want to deal with me. She was rude and making eyes at her coworker while I spoke.
In terms of the actual store here, I gave it 2 stars because I do like BR clothes. A complaint for this location is the organization of their sales racks. At other stores the items are sorted by size but this store is always a mess and it feels like shopping at a discount store where you have to dig to get a find.
I like the BR chain but this store is not up to par in terms of service with other locations. You'd be better of shopping online or heading to Scottsdale.","review","CMXr9mlVmwC3VjTNvX3ZFA",0,1,3,"Banana Republic","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Chandler","AZ","Clothing"

If it is more than $10.00 you have to pay for it yourself. Ahhh that is not BR policy.

"5y88Y-RbndE0QNwQMeScew","2008-02-16","io7H-uQk8jznwq64wADXwg",3,"Let me start by saying that American Apparel makes fantastic t-shirts. I'm a serious t-shirt collector and have been for decades. I pay attention to that type of junk because I was involved in the d.i.y. punk scene as a kid and if you're in a band, printing your own t-shirts was par for the course... From Anvil to Hanes to newer brands like Gildan - I've tried them all. For awhile it looked like Oneita was going to be the last ""made in the USA"" company around - quality shirts there - but several years ago, they seem to have dropped out. 

Everything has been pretty much Gildan - tourist shirts and event shirts and anything cheap or free - it's Gildan. You can even pick up some blanks for a couple bucks at Walgreens if you like. The problem with them is that they are totally unreliable fit-wise. They react unpredictably to the drier - sometimes getting wider and shorter or twisting or losing hem threads. They also aren't very soft - they are very heavy, but they aren't very high-end. 

I realize it seems silly to have a high-end t-shirt, but that's what American Apparel makes. Their shirts always fit perfectly - they are all made exactly the same and they make anyone with a halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy. They are somewhat fitted without being tight. They are all soft and the cotton is combed to a rich and durable state. These shirts don't form holes as easily as other shirts I've owned - even heavier shirts I have form holes near where they rub against my belt buckle... AA do not. Their seams always hold as well.

I can easily say that American Apparel are the most reliable and best made blank t-shirt available. When buying shirts online, I only buy prints on AA shirts because I know they'll look great on me. So many online companies now use AA shirts these days as well, so it's easy.

So what about this store? What about the rest of it? Well, the store is bright and full of colorful clean blank clothes. On the women's side, there are lots of great skirts and dresses made of soft cotton. Mostly just summer accessories really as nothing here is thick enough to wear as winter cover. It is meant to be layered though as you can see by the mannequins. They have great socks and leggings and I'm told they make the best and most comfortable thongs in the business... so if you are a woman and you want to try some comfy thongs - give these a shot.

The men's side is more of a unisex area because apart from the shirts, all of the clothes they sell to men are super gay... and I'm not trying to insult anyone, it's just seriously things that are far too flamboyant for even metrosexuals. They definitely expect you to be rail skinny to buy clothes here although they carry larger sizes. They sell jeans, but they are of the skinny type. Some of the fun of going in here is to look at the gold lamet jackets and telling your friends you are going to buy it to see their reaction. 

The kids that work here are hip scenesters hired for their look rather than their work ethic. They are all thin and their level of helpfulness varies wildly between 'not' and 'somewhat'. The store is very well-lit and it's easy to find things. The models they use for the advertising and 'artwork' posted around the store look like early-stage bruised up meth addicts or early 70s porn stars. 

The biggest problem with this store really is simply that their clothing is overpriced. Sure, it's nice and well-made, but it's also expensive. Considering you can buy their blank t-shirts for 3-5 bucks each from online bulk sellers... the exact same shirts they sell in the store for 3-5 times that amount. 60 bucks for a jacket that looks like it would come in a 5 dollar hurricane survival kit doesn't spell value to me. I really think the only good reason to go here would be if you were a girl and you wanted to buy some thongs or socks or leggings or a skirt or dress. If you just want a t-shirt, there are much cheaper ways to obtain them... for both men and women. 

It's great having an AA location in the valley if for no other reason than to just have it... but a smart shopper can do better.","review","Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg",6,3,7,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

I tried Mastrionni Fashions, which has served me well a few times before. No luck. Then I went near Boca Park. I figured my odds of success would increase by searching at a larger retail area. First, I tired Banana Republic across the street. They had one red button-up shirt for $60, it felt very thin and cheaply made. Then since I was there, I tried the Gap next door. No surprise, even worse luck. 

Almost giving up, I shot across the street to the Men's Wearhouse. I walked in and was greeted by a nice salesman. I told him the situation, and he was eager to help. He measured my neck, arm length and chest. Then he grabbed a solid red shirt for me. It was dead-perfect. They had a 2 for 1 sale going on. He showed me the section of shirts that would fit me, and I grabbed another shirt that I liked. It was also a perfect fit. The shirts here were at least three times the quality of the crap that Banana Republic was trying to sell. Wrinkle free FTW!! And at two-for-one, they came out to about $40 each. They also had just received some great hockey sweatshirts and jackets that were also two-for-one. I grabbed two great Rangers items for my dad and got some Christmas shopping done while I was there. Everyone from the salesman to the lady ringing me up were extremely friendly and helpful. The salesman steamed my shirts and another salesman was trying to give me crap about the Rangers, suggesting I bought some Red Wings stuff instead. It gave me a pretty good laugh. 

In summary, I would definitely return to this Men's Wearhouse for future purchases. I was taken care of from the moment I stepped through the door, to the moment I left. Plus, they aint just whistlin' Dixie when they ""guarantee"" you'll like the way you look.

I have recently taken a job where I have to dress formally everyday. I was in the store to buy a few new suits and am very unhappy with how one of them fits. I feel like a 10 year old wearing my dads suit. It is gigantic. After a few alterations the suit still felt big. When I had it altered initially I mentioned that the suit was huge and the store associate darla said it looked good and they couldn't take it in anymore. A few weeks later I wore the suit once and it was horrible. Jacket was too long and the pants made me feel like I was wearing a tent. I took it back. They said they could alter it. The staff was not apologetic for not doing it right the first time and overall the team was very unfriendly. Like I was an inconvenience in their day. They said they could alter it would cost me another $15 and would take almost 10+ days. I will get this suit, but will not be buying anything here again. The sales lady was constantly blaming the other tailors for doing a poor job and said the best tailor was back and that the other tailors were not very good. I will not be back. If this is how your staff treat each other. No wonder the client experience was so poor.

They don't put enough people on the floor so obviously the associates are constantly trying to clean and when they get distracted by a customer, another customer goes ahead and either leaves trash or clothes on the floor in the mean time, I see it. Not to mention when there's already enough clothes in each room, the visual team HAS to put more clothes in the rooms because that's their job. I understand there is certain employees who either just started and don't know what there doing or other ones who just don't care  about their job and don't know why there still there.
But then again there are the great employees who will help you for about 20 mins because what you're looking for is probably in the wrong section/ room like half the things are. So don't blame them, more than half the time its customers leaving literally bags of clothes in rooms/ shelves or hanging in the wrong area because they decided they didn't want it anymore!! 
It also depends what time you go when forever has a whole room for jewelry  because those items go the quickest! Anyway, you can call ahead of time to ask if they only have a wall of jewelry or if the whole accessories room has mostly jewelry and they will tell you.
Also, the shoes will only be in one section which is right behind the accessories wall, yes there will be shoes on the wall in certain rooms but you has to understand that most of them are from a few months ago or more and in forever time there is a high chance that they will not have any extras in the back because clothes/shoes/etc do not last very long because they only make about 15-20 extras of everything and those go by quick over months.
BUT never be afraid to ask them to look in the stock room for clothes or shoes because they always have something there just most of the time they make up excuses to how nothing's there. Shoes tend to go by the fastest but it never hurts to check.
All in all this forever has 11 rooms not including the 3 huge center sections that have different styles in each one. No one can say that they don't have variety and if you're one of those people than you obviously have not looked through those thousands of racks thoroughly and one by one because there is still even clothes from 2012 in there and as for customer service it depends who you get, if your not happy with someone who's helping you just ask for another employee or complain to a manager.  And obviously Friday's, Saturday's And Sunday's are their busiest days so u can definitely plan on waiting in big lines after 11am on those days. My favorite days to go are Monday through Wednesday. Occasionally there is big lines but not nearly as crazy/ messy as the weekends. Forever has great prices for so much variety and make sure to read your receipt before deciding to return it. NO REFUNDS/ only store credit or even exchange/ and you can absolutely not exchange anything from the sale section even if it was the wrong size and you found the same exact size in a M. 

I go for the clothes and prices, not the exceptional service or organized rooms or their crappy return policy that many customers tend to either cuss them out over or try to start fights.","review","FdmJJI4dBdxvfm4nrhsNWA",0,0,0,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Tempe","AZ","Clothing"

This is the second time I've had to go to their customer service department to correct things on my original purchase, but they made everything right pronto. Here are the salient things you need to know to claim your Kohl's discounts:

1) When you get a sales flyer/magazine in the mail from Kohl's that says you can save an additional percentage off of the upcoming in-store sale, peel off the sticker to reveal your additional savings (usually 10%, 20%, or 30%) and BRING THE MAILER WITH YOU to the store. I didn't realize I had to do this once because I thought it would get deducted automatically when I used my Kohl's charge card... but no. I had to return the next day to get it resolved.

2) When approaching the checkout at the Kohl's store, PRESENT YOUR ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT and/or COUPONS FIRST. I got an inexperienced cashier who never asked beforehand, rang up all of my merch, and then looked a bit flabbergasted when I dropped the discount code on her. She tried to key it all in again and even had a manager come over to approve, but actually only applied my discount to one of my many items. I came back the next day and got it resolved.

3) It may take a day or two for new transactions to register on your on-line Kohl's charge card account. I like to pay my balance down to zero right-quick, but sometimes after I've had to correct a transaction with customer service, I have to wait for the balance to be updated.

I'm not bothered too much by any of these issues (although it is why I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5), because I have found tremendous savings at this and other Kohl's stores. In my opinion, this Gilbert store has one of the better inventories in the men's department. I can almost always find my size and they seem to be very efficient about getting tried-on clothing refolded and back onto the racks.

Case in point: I stocked up on polo shirts recently. Retail price came to an average of $36 per shirt. Kohl's Father's Day sale prices brought the average down to $17.15 per shirt. Apply 20% cardholder special discount and the price was $14.16. I've paid more for T-shirts at other stores! Total savings on this trip was $183.89.

Kohl's put the ""disco"" in discount. Think I gotta dance now...","review","0Ke0iSAPYi8hUVxLocAlYQ",0,1,2,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Jewelry,Beauty & Spas,Men's Clothing,Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Gilbert","AZ","Clothing"

I did not order these items. These items were not discussed with me. JCPenney felt free to print up these items, using images of my dog and my child without my consent.  I felt emotionally blackmailed. 

As for the rest of the experience, they take 20 images for their copyright free image cd. I understand that they can't take unlimited pictures, but they took closer to 50 pictures and made me choose which ones to get rid of. There is apparently no way to retrieve these images once they've moved on to the next screen, so ask them to warn you before they do so if you think you're human and might change your mind.

It is nonsensical and stingy not to simply include all of these images on the cd.

The staff is friendly. Some of them seemed slightly confused about the inner workings of their computer system. The manager was much better at the basics of photography than her subordinate. I don't blame the employees so much as Penneys for insufficient training.

My husband and I went in on Monday, 11/30, to look at a few Michael Kors handbags; unfortunately we were short on time and didn't get to see the entire store. However, the parts that we did tour (Men's clothing and the handbag area) were both extremely clean, organized and seemed to be surprisingly well-stocked with popular/good looking items. We had been a little disillusioned recently, by other department stores, due to lack of selection. A lot of places seem to be falling off the cart when it comes to knowing what is ""in style"" now. We were both happy to see that this Macy's location was not one of them. 

When we came to the handbag area (which was also very clean and nicely laid out) a very pleasant older woman (I think her name was Sandra) greeted us and informed us of a pre-sale that was going on. We walked out of Macy's having reserved 2 Michael Kors handbags (I'm a lucky girl this Christmas! : ) . However, we probably would not have gotten two, if it weren't for Sandra, who gave us the 25% pre-sale discount on BOTH bags (one of which was already marked down as ""on sale""). 

I went into this Macy's not really expecting to see a good selection of handbags, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Because of their willingness to work with you on price, I WILL return to this Macy's. :)","review","bJU6SHipYbw6PiNs5k47Ng",0,0,0,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Madison","WI","Clothing"

i was looking for a perfume i saw at an anthro in ohio while visiting family.  while on vacation in vegas, i stopped in the anthro on the strip with my bf in search of the smelly smells i liked in the midwest.  i didn't see it on the shelves so i asked an associate.  when she couldn't find it, she enlisted the help of her coworkers for an online store inventory search of other stores.  when i mentioned i lived in the bay area, she checked their inventory, and provided me a number not only to the sf store but to her store in case the online inventory was incorrect.  she insisted she could call around and have it shipped to me at home if it didn't work out at the sf store.

...dang.  and all i wanted to do was smell it.

by far, above and beyond the normal customer service.  i wanted to buy it just because the girl was so conscientious.

broke ass grad student lesson # 359: um, it's anthro.  the only way to get a deal is to pray what you want will go into clearance.  it's the only way to afford to buy anything at this store, since the prices on sale go back down to a normal price for clothing or home furnishings.","review","Ob8aEByTHwp5KMZ_XWKfng",1,1,2,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Like most Anthro locations, there is a sales ""closet"" ripe with markdowns; many items which were new to the racks less than a full season before. 

THIS Anthro's sales closet resembles my closet at home, in the sense that it spills over and out...and there are many more racks to explore. 

As always, Anthropologie has many lush options to pursue, fondle, and when the price is right - purchase. The sales closet at the Foum Shops is the best I've experienced.

This location also has the largest selection of handbags and jewelry that I've come across... AND furniture. I'm fond of Keith Johnson and Man Shops Globe so I love visiting an Anthro that has one of a kind finds in the way of housewares.... Now, if only I could hit a winning slot or table....  

In all their bright (and muted) colors... in book form, house wares and fabrics that yearn to be touched... (fondled)... it would certainly be easy to transfer a paycheck (or two) directly over... but it is the boutique charm and the reminder that quality over quantity that pokes at a deeper 'before consumerist' memory within me that has me leaving with no more than one amazing piece at a time (and perhaps a book or two).","review","JamU8W3AjMIqoQIkFsHaXw",3,3,4,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

I find Kohl's to be the kind of store I have to be in the mood to deal with. A lot of times one has to sort through the crap to find the good stuff and since Grandma likes to hit the sales rack first, I had to dig deep to find the patience to deal with everything. Luckily, we were able to find a few things that worked for her and I was glad. I was also happy that she listened to me when it came to sizing and was very grateful that the dressing rooms were large enough for both of us to be in. My Grandma is now 88 and I look like her. I have a feeling I know what my body will look like when I am 88 as well and once I managed to swallow that reality, we both had a little bit of a laugh. 

Customer service isn't the best at this location and I guess they get quite a few shoplifters as there was a police takedown going on in the housewares section as we walked by.

It's neatly arranged with more of the party type clothes (tops, dresses, etc) up front and the more casual items toward the back.

I definitely recommend trying stuff on at Forever 21...it's definitely helpful because some stuff that looks ""long"" on the hanger ends up being hoochie mama short once on! I do not recommend going into this store if you are short on time...it takes awhile to go through all the clothes; plus depending on when you go, the line for the dressing room can be long (note: they only allow you to try on 6 items at a time), and checkout can take time.

Yes, it is a complete shopping nightmare.

I don't even know where to begin. This store in particular (at Chandler Fashion Center) is HUGE. Beyond enormous. It's so big, it has its own entrance/exit leading outside the mall. It's like four or five of the smaller clothing stores you'll find inside the mall put together. 

This wouldn't be such a bad thing if this store had ANY form of organization, but it doesn't. Everything is set up in a completely random, nonsensical order, which makes trying to find anything specific a dizzying and frustrating experience. There are various ""rooms"" throughout the store that all have their own set of shirts, dresses, pants, bottoms, purses, etc. The only items that are grouped together are jewelry and handbags, but even those can be found littered throughout the store. The store associates don't even know where to locate something, so don't bother asking unless you're feeling brave.

To further prove my point, I went into the store to exchange an item I had bought online that was too large. I was pointed to one room, where the cashier guessed the item might be. When I asked the salesperson if there were any other colors available for this item, she told me to go check another room... on the opposite side of the store. WTF?! Why are two items of the same style in different rooms? I think they just like to mess with their customers' heads.

So shopping here is nearly impossible and kind of exhausting. You basically have to browse the entire store to find things you like that might fit you. Everything runs small, like they're meant for small-framed girls. This is also why you will see plenty of 8-year-olds running around with gaudy fashion jewelry and handbags, swiping their parents' credit cards as they ring up the latest of F21's thousands of items.

That's another problem here - the store's inventory is changing CONSTANTLY. Sure, there's a great selection, but if you buy something that doesn't fit and come back a few weeks later, you might not be able to exchange it anymore because it's no longer there.

On the plus side, the clothes are cute (albeit cheaply made) and extremely affordable. But going into the store to shop isn't worth the experience. I've decided to stick to online shopping when it comes to this one. You will save yourself hours of frustration by doing the same.","review","8PBN6_K1rgPbFT_6z-LWCw",0,0,0,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Chandler","AZ","Clothing"

I know Forever21 isn't really known much for their customer service, but the associate I asked for very minimal help (to help me find two pairs of shorts I was trying to exchange) was incredibly rude about it. 

I had asked another associate (at the register) if I could get some help finding them. She asked an associate who had walked up to the register. She rolled her eyes and walked over to me. When I asked her where the shorts was, she told me they were ""uh, right there"" on a rack next to me .... where they weren't. While I asked her about another pair, she looked incredibly impatient and annoyed that I had asked her another question. 

I have been working in customer service (both fashion and other types of retail) for six years. Again, I know customer service isn't #1 in Forever21's list of importance in their stores, but I don't think it's necessary to be impatient and rude when a customer asks for two quick questions.

That in mind, I only really come into this store when I need an accessory and don't feel like paying a lot for it.

Back in August after my partial thyroidectomy + mass removal - AND while waiting for the final pathology report to come back,  I needed a light scarf that was plain black I could use to cover my bloody neck incision while the swelling dies down. There's nothing like some guy gawking and screaming, ""AHH LOOK, A ZOMBIE!"" at you when you're shopping at Frys to make you feel self-conscious.

So I ventured into this Forever 21, and couldn't find one. I approached a teenage looking CSR. 

""Excuse me, do you know if you have any other - *gets cut off*"" 

""*eye rolling* I'M SORRY BUT I'M OFF THE CLOCK, I NEED TO PUNCH OUT LYK OMG YOU BITCH HOW DARE YOU *walks away*!"" 

Infuriated, I got in the 5-mile-line that was the back to school rush. I asked to speak to the manager. Wish I remembered her name, because she was just as useless as the CSR. Was either too busy farting around with a friend or another customer to truly listen to what I had to say. Granted, I was a little out of control. But still unacceptable. 

1. ""I'm really sorry, I'll have _______ help you out!"" 
- Nope, that's OK. 

2. ""I don't think she's here today.""
- I WAS TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY SECONDS AGO, M'AM!  

I think Forever 21 as a whole, not just this store, missed this fundamental lesson:

Rule #1 of Customer Service: There is no cure for a poor experience. 
Rule #2 of Customer Service: There is no cure for sucking. 
Rule #3: You MUST provide a GREAT Customer Service Experience . . . or someone ELSE will! 

Needless to say, I will NOT be back. Ever. Obviously, there are places with higher quality clothes, and their customer service is / can be superior.

You might be a small in one shirt and a large in another. Do not ever buy a pair of the pants without trying them first, if you can brave the dirty, unkempt fitting rooms. If you do attempt buying anything without trying it on, good luck with the return policy. I visited this location today on a search for some inexpensive layering tee's. I asked one associate whom was gossiping to her friend about another employee where I could locate a different size. She informed me that she could not leave ""her area"" and that she didn't know what sizes are left and that I should go ask the girl in the front of the store. I proceeded to the front of the store to find the tee's I was looking for strewn across a table that looked like it had been hit by a tornado.

Sometimes they also hand out coupons at the store with your purchase, for your next visit. 
Their Return/Exchange service is quick and friendly, and the dressing rooms were very tidy.
I shop for clothes here every year when I visit. Granted, my taste in clothing is a bit unusual, so clothes shopping in chain stores is a challenge. But somehow I always manage to find stuff I like at Kohl's. They carry a range of designers, from ""trendy"" names (snicker) like JLo and Lauren Conrad to more basic Croft & Barrow type stuff. 
There are almost no skirts sold in this store, except for a couple of generic business skirts and some gynecologist-friendly miniskirts by Candies.

Today I had a specific need to replace my cute black boots that were falling apart with another pair of black boots and also found a nice pair of grey boots.  So I cart my boots to the front and the cashier proceeds to be really pushy about getting their credit card.  

It's as bad as Barnes & Noble trying to get me to purchase their ""discount membership"".  Dang it.  If I wanted your damn credit card I would have it.  She brought it up 4 times, and I finally had to take a deep breath and just tell her with a straight face, ""I've thought about this very deeply and at great length, and I'm at peace with not having a Kohl's credit card.""  

I think she thought I was a weirdo.  I don't care.  The pushiness to open a line of credit really annoys me.

Calm the hell down Debt Pusher, but if someone doesn't know about the Kohl's card they have been living under a rock.

BAHAHA, at least she made it into a trashcan thanks to quick thinking on her father's part when he took it from behind the registers and rushed it to her. They were really nice and understanding about it, even let her use their personal restroom and asked her if she was okay and offered some water. 

OTHERWISE, honestly 2 stars. We were there for tux rentals. They had the jacket, pants and shoes to try on, but none of the vests, shirts, ties or bow ties. We wanted to see what the whole ensemble would look like before making a final decision but that is not an option, at least not at this location, because they only had swatch samples. Also, very poor color and design selection for vests and ties. They lack variety. I bet it's safe to assume if you went through a Men's Wearhouse company for your wedding or prom...you probably have the same (or very similar) tux as half the other guys at the event. Since Deanna directed us straight towards Vera Wang's collection first and then two other styles and not bothering to mention any of the other tux on display I'm almost certain that that is routine for all the other workers, so we are all most likely renting one of the 3 styles they first and foremost try to sell us on. Does that make sense? I don't know, it's making sense to me in my head though, hah. 

But ultimately we are still renting from them, so I guess it is what it is and I shouldn't complain, haha.","review","nrl_-x1SB7BY4il49WmttA",1,1,1,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Cute little shirts for $10 - $15.  That's it.  That's all.  I don't care about anything else that they sell, but they have cute little shirts for cheap.  They have cute little prints, come in all kings of different cute little cuts, and after a few washings they're super soft.  Sure, they get thin and faded sooner than other things but 1) thin and faded is OK, that's what layers are for and 2) did I mention $10 - $15?  I get about a year's wear out of their shirts so I figure the return on investment is pretty awesome.

Oh, for a perpetual kid like myself, they also have an awesome plastic jewelry selection.

Last night, I saw two racks that had bright yellow signs with ""$5.99"", but when I got closer, it also had ""& up"" in tiny font lettering. These are the attention-getting tactics to get people in the door. And yes, it worked, because I actually walked in (yeah, I admit to it). 

My husband noted that this is a smaller store compared to the mammoth one at the Fashion Show Mall and the Meadows Mall, but when you go into the store, it's rather deep/long. I noticed there were two people working here. Both were putting more clothes on the racks, which I thought were pretty full. It's pretty organized and clean.

In the back were crazy, colorful printed frocks- dresses mostly (think ethnic, guatemala or even world). This is also where one of the girls was restocking more clothing. 

In the middle was costume jewelry. There were some cute, but heavy, chunky, metal pieces (statement necklaces). There were feather necklaces (but they seem to be everywhere). There was a good assortment- something for everybody. I'm having a jewelry phase currently (but I wear it all, silver, gold, gemstone, pearls, costume jewelry). I found a three strand milky green acrylic beaded goldtone necklace with chain extender for $6.80. It's in one of my favorite colors (green and blue), so I bought it. 

A few years ago, on the Tyra Banks show, she spoke about the ""High-Low"" technique of mixing pricey pieces with inexpensive pieces. This store seems to fit the ""Low"" in terms of affordability. I can see why many women are fans of this brand- one can stock up on trendy basics here. My niece loves this store BTW.

Checkout was easy- the girl was nice too. There were a few other people at checkout as well. 

Towards the front of the store, there were separates, lightweight sweaters, skirts, and tops.","review","XjfKBr96h6GgrfkR_q6gIA",1,0,0,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Customer service was nonexistent. It's not that there wasn't employees working, I saw 3 doing busy work. But I was never greated, nor asked if I needed help, even though I circled the store three times looking for things. 

I say that the employees were doing busy work because the store was a mess. The lack of assistance would be somewhat understandable if the ladies were working hard to keep the store clean and organized, but jewlery was all over the place (including the floor), clothes were unorganized.

We all know their clothing is constructed of fabric which is one step up (or down) from a Bounty paper towel, and no doubt crafted by children with bloated bellies chained to rusty sewing machines in a rat-infested, third world sweatshop (ok I'm just guessing on that last part. But a lot of the seams aren't that straight.). The point is, most of the crap they sell falls apart after a few washings, but that's fine for their demographic, which is younger women and girls on a budget who want cute clothes that they will tire of after a few wearings anyway, so no harm, no foul.

This review is of the company and their business practices. 

I purchased a gift card for Forever 21 from the rack at a Lowe's, and one for Sephora. I put them away, and when I went to wrap them for my daughter, they were gone. I have a creepy feeling I might have accidentally thrown away the bag. Yikes!

So, I returned to Lowe's, where they scanned my receipt, found the serial numbers for the cards, and gave me the 800 numbers to call the companies. (5 stars, Lowe's)!

Then, I called Sephora, who checked and found that the card had not been used, cancelled it, and sent me a new one (5 stars, Sephora).

Then, I called Forever 21, who checked, found the card had not been used, cancelled it. assured me no one could use it, but COULD NOT ISSUE A REPLACEMENT! WTF??!!  They KNOW the card was paid for, they KNOW they got my money, the KNOW no one can use the card, but I'm supposed to be satisfied with giving them money for nothing? I was outraged. Their website had no address to write to (guess they must be tired of hate mail), but had a ""customer service "" (HA!) contact e-mail address, which apparently is even easier to ignore...

She and another girl lead me to her and the manager had put it in the lost and found drawer!  I was so happy that they looked out for me!

If you are going to shop somewhere that has lots of clothes for pennies, you have to expect that there will be lots of teenagers.  And apparently teenagers don't know how to keep clothes off of the ground.  When you are here, especially on a weekend, expect there to be about 17% of the clothes lying on the floor while another 25% are haphazardly hanging on the racks.

Also expect very loud, bass-filled music to be blaring over the speakers and long waits in the dressing rooms.

Sometimes I have the patience for this and can manage to stay here awhile to sort through the clothes.  This is usually during the week when it isn't so messy.  But there have been times when the Lord hadn't granted me patience for the day and I got so irritated at the mess that I left.

(Just a side note here: This is not the fault of the employees- they are working their butts off keeping the store clean.  The problem is, there needs to be about 7 times more employees here to keep up with it all.)

Despite the messes and brain-thumping music, I will continue to shop at Forever 21.  I do find a lot of clothes and jewelry that I wear for both work and hanging out (like the shirt I am currently wearing as I'm writing this).  I prefer this location to the others in town; The Galleria is too small and Fashion Show is incredibly large and quite possibly the First Circle of Hell.

If you are looking for solid-color, basic pieces like tanks and tees, this is definitely a good place to stop.  Also consider Forever 21 if you need a costume for something- they have some crazy items and the prices are so low you won't feel bad about wearing it just once.

"DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA","2014-06-20","9U0FF69TOFifIe5YS5G8Pg",1,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.

1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.
2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.
3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.
4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.
5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.
6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.
7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.
8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.
9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 
10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.

Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.""

Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""

Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.

TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.","review","h55P31ql7npvguOLm0Yc8A",0,0,0,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Homestead","PA","Clothing"

Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left.

As an article describing the store puts it, it is ""designed like a walk-in closet with a residential feel.""  Huh?  It just feels claustrophobic to me.  The clothes are in hallways in no discernible order.  But they do have some cute stuff on occasion that my neighborhood store does not have.

The salespeople here have been less enthusiastic here, in my experience.  They have never checked in on me while I've been in the dressing room (but they've left them unlocked, at least, so I can get in).  They also tend to focus on the negative.  For example, the Luxe club, their frequent buyer club where you have to spend $800 per year.  You can get free alterations, but the salespeople I've talked to about it start with all the damn rules - basic alterations only, no cuffs, no lining, thread may not match the clothing.  Whaa?  Returns have been a pain in ass here, too, in my experience.  If you buy with a rewards certificate, you can't get the rewards certificate back on a return unless you are in the Luxe club.  You can't use gift certificates and reward certificates together.  Too many rules!  And I don't even know if those are the rules... it's just what the people in this particular store have told me.

I like to pop in every so often to see if there is something cute.  I have gotten some of my favorite clothes here, so I'll give it an A-OK.","review","yj4lNvmxAt42NvBCxB3WTw",2,1,2,"Banana Republic","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

It's always best to go here when the stuff is on sale though, because if it's not on sale, you could be spending 40 dollars on one shirt. When you see a sign that says ""Kohls"" sale, run run run to your nearest Kohls! I bought 3 pairs of pants for about 60 bucks. That seems expensive, but considering most female clothing stores are 50 bucks each pair of pants, 20 dollars a pair of pants (19.99 technically) is a pretty amazing deal. 

The reason I am giving this four stars though, is because of those 4 times (except for the very last time) my mother and I felt as though we were being followed by one of the managers or workers. We were looking over the shoes, and a bald manager in a purple shirt came over and pretended to be looking to see if things were tidy. What he didn't see, is me behind my mom watching him stare at her as she tried shoes on.

Then, the next time we came in, the same guy followed me while I was looking at the 7 dollar sale ring display. He started phoning in on his radio, and it made me feel really nervous and guilty, and I wasn't even shop lifting. I don't like entering a store, and just because I look young, people have to stare at you like you're going to steal. That, I consider very, very rude. 

The third time, I came in with my mom (about 4 months later) and sure enough, that guy was on me like glue. I don't know if maybe someone who looked like me got caught shop lifting in the past, and he thought I was that person, or what....but I'm actually nervous to go in that store now, because I feel like I'm going to get jumped by workers everytime I enter, for a crime I never even thought about committing, LOL. 

Besides that one single guy, every other worker was kind, polite, and very helpful, as the other reviews said.  Also, I find that this one has more clothes that would look good on younger women such as myself. A few other Kohl's I've been to tend to focus more on older women, so for the longest time I never even bothered stepping foot into a Kohls because when I did, I'd see older women's clothing and the only choices for younger women's clothing was some skimpy skirts and ugly shirts. I'm really glad this Kohls is so close to me, because their younger women's clothing is very, very cute, and most of what I've seen lay low on the skimpiness. Definitely take your daughter to this specific Kohls if you want to find her clothes that won't show off what shouldn't be shown!","review","cShyqupygLI8ndbq7NIZvA",0,0,0,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Jewelry,Beauty & Spas,Men's Clothing,Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Queen Creek","AZ","Clothing"

First of all, of the clothing that they offered, I must say that I was really disappointed.  I'm a 30 something and while I'm not going to go around sporting the hipster look, I'm not ready for retirement.  Nothing I found was particularly fabulous and I ended up finding a few passable items in what I assume was the ""juniors"" area and quickly found out that there's a reason they have a juniors and a misses area in stores.  The pants I bought even though I went a size up from my usual size were still not big enough for me.  I'm not a teenage girl anymore I know.. but a bigger size was still so small I couldn't zip them up or even fit my thighs.  I've put in panty hose easier than these pants and everything I found was hip hugger style.   I was looking for casual office attire and instead I just looked like a 30 something trying to pathetically hold on to my youth or something.  That, however, was the bad side. 

The housewares.. bedding/linens, bathroom goods, kitchenware/cookware exceeded my expectations.  If I can't find things at a thrift store, I'm either forced to look at Target or Walmart or pay the overpriced department store prices.  Not true at Kohls.  I found good quality for affordable prices and if you go at the right time and stick to the ""sale"" items, one can get a lot of very nice things for very little money.   I could have spent a fortune there.  I got the most beautiful duvet that although it was missing a sham from the set, it was normally $250 marked down to $54.  I walked out of there with my ""savings"" at around $400 and aside from the clothing which I returned all of it, I had a good experience.

Overall, I will still continue my shopping at other venues, but I will add in Kohl's to my shopping rotations when buying for the house.","review","6ms7fAY1vyKz1Zw89YCFaQ",0,0,0,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Jewelry,Beauty & Spas,Men's Clothing,Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Queen Creek","AZ","Clothing"

They also have extremely hassle free, no questions asked returns!!  You can also not have your receipt without any problem.

The only thing is, for me it's kind of hit or miss, I'm over 30 so I  don't always find clothes here as a lot of it is very teen oriented or for the older woman.. there isn't really a sort of in between section..

Today I came here with my sister who was shopping for clothes for my baby niece. We had the baby in the stroller and made our way to the toddler clothes. As we were walking (on the walkway) towards the department in the back of the store we rounded a corner where we encountered a very large group of employees (about 8 or 9) who looked to be having some sort of staff meeting in the middle of the walkway. My sister was walking the stroller on through and politely said to the group ""excuse me"". They did clear the way but not without me hearing one of the ladies say under her breath that we could have found another way to go around. HOW RUDE! Excuse us Miss hallway hog for walking down the aisle of your store and giving you business! I have worked in retail customer service and management for over six years and I would be appalled if I heard an associate talk to customers like that. RUDE!

 Kohl's does have great deals on infant and toddler clothing and some really cute items which earned them back a star. The checkout process was very good and the cashier gave my sister an additional coupon which won back two more stars. Basically it seems like the above mentioned hallway hog associate was having a bad day or simply doesn't want to be there but there are good people working here as well.

I would LOVE to have a Macy's so close that I can actually shop at.

I agree with one of the other reviews about the selection or lack there of. This has to be one of the WORST department stores I have ever visited, as far as selection goes. I'm a pretty conservative woman in my 30's.....the women's apparel that has been selected is just terrible. I feel as though it is TOO conservative. If I was looking for new church clothes or something to wear to a conservative political function, I would shop here. There needs to be more options for women that have professional jobs AND still like to be stylish. Your shoe department is pretty awful as well. Please, please, please give us something we can wear to work that's hip and professional, and something we can wear out for dinner or cocktails.(besides a formal gown)

First of all, if you want any cute tights, or the fun ones with bling or cute designs...or anything updated and contemporary in terms of tights/hose...don't expect to find any here!! 

Anyways, I found a pair of plain black tights (mashed on the wall with unlike styles and with no sort of organization or merchandising skills applied - per typical Macy's standards I guess).  I found another pair since they were 2/$22 hue deal and I grabbed a pair of black leggings.  

So I turn to see 8 people in line at this one checkout station, then walk across the floor to another checkout station with 10 people waiting.  I'm clearly standing in the middle of the aisle holding product to buy...and the lovely Aspen appears. 

Now, I saw her trying to fly by me without greeting or any type of extension of customer service skills. But I saw the name tag and the portable printer on her hip...I yelled after her ""excuse me? can you ring me up?""  

Oooooh man!!! She looked like I just ran over her foot. 

She literally said to me (first words) ""if you're paying credit. And if you want a bag, go to a register"". 


I wanted to say ""FU$& YOU ASPEN"" but I didn't want to sink to her crap level. 

Instead, I said ""yeah, credit card. I'm fine with that as long as nobody talks to me on my way out...as I'm holding these things in my hands.""  

She didn't say a word.  She started scanning. Asking me to hold this like that. And let her out the sticker there. Um, YOURE WELCOME ASPEN.  She was a total B!! the whole time. Not one, thanks for helping. Or thanks for holding this. Upon printing my receipt, her words were ""here's your receipt"". 

Again, no thank you. Or come again. Or sorry we have such long lines. Or happy holidays. So rude.

Also the layout is pretty cool too, you walk in to the Men's and Women's, fitting rooms are in the middle and kids in the back! But also there are so many other stores here...Target, Kohls and Bed Bath and Beyond...just to name a few! 

With great prices and very nice associates I am definitely going to be back!","review","PM2jXrlVzik1jDwwahLJJQ",0,0,0,"Old Navy","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

CRAP styles too, its like a clash between late 70's early 80's. DRAB DRAB DRAB.

They carry a TON of sizes (not everyone is a size 2), they usually have things on sale, and I get a ton of clothing for my 2 year old as well. Old Navy has come a long way since I used to shop here (well, the one in Baltimore) back in high school. The clothing has gotten better- and I have multiple pieces of ON clothing that have help up longer than American Eagle OR the Gap. I'm also glad they downsized the layout- it was too big and bulky before- a smart move by merchandisers. The staff is usually helpful and friendly and they have lots of cute things in stock- the colors are getting better, the selections of styles are getting better.

The floor associates are very nice and really go the extra step to help customers choose the best fitting jeans.  While I have always found the floor associates helpful, the cashiers are far less pleasant.

My trip on March 1st was the most disturbing.  The store was pretty busy because of the $15 sale on jeans.  Finding a floor associate that wasn't helping another customer was impossible.  I took my purchases to the counter and asked the cashier to check the stores inventory for a size 6 pants for my little girl.  She said there were plenty on the shelf.  I told her I looked repeatedly but was not able to find a pair.  I suggested that the pants must have been on a shelf too high for me to reach.  She then asked me if I wanted to pay for my items, then go back and try to reach the pants on my own then stand in line again to complete a second transaction.  I told her I did not want to do that...that I wanted her to have an associate get the pants for me (seeing as I did not have a ladder) and ring up all my items on a single transaction.  With a very disapproving look, she said ""fine"" and stormed off.  Very unpleasant experience.

Would give five stars if not for the terrible check out service.  My latest experience was extreme but the cashiers have always been less than friendly.  I guess cashiers and floor associates receive different training.

As a side note, the tiny clearance section allows only a few shoppers at a time.  Any more than that and you could start feeling claustrophobic.","review","WG2xO5JKpmoILmebttYj_Q",0,0,1,"Old Navy","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

It seems like a decent store but it really isn't my style. Plus, I'm no longer in my teens or early twenties - so not my demographic either. The only reason I stopped in was because I was in the area and I needed a birthday present for a male friend. I knew Urban Outfitters had not only clothing but had other random gifts and I thought I'd give it a try. 

After wandering through the clothing, I found the ""gifts"" section. There were plenty of mustached emblazed gifts from flasks to mugs to beer cozies. Mainly, they had drinking accessories which was a good thing because the friend I was shopping for loves to drink. I found some whiskey stones - stones you place in the freezer for use in your whiskey so the whiskey doesn't become diluted with ice. This was the perfect gift because my friend is a whiskey enthusiast. (I later found out I could purchase the same gift online for cheaper but oh well.)

I grabbed my gift and made my way to the cashier. There were quite a few other patrons in the store but there was no one in line to check-out. There was one lonely employee who helped me check out and I was on my way.

Overall, it's a nice, large store with plenty of space for both merchandise and movement. There is barely any parking outside, so it's best to park in the parking garage and walk over. It's next to a few restaurants and other shopping, so not a bad location either. I believe it is the only Urban Outfitters in Scottsdale, so if that is your thing, definitely check it out.","review","tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww",1,0,0,"Urban Outfitters","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Home & Garden,Men's Clothing,Women's Clothing","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

2. Made in the USA, sure. Also happens to be made by a company with very questionable ethics and ads, and a CEO (Dov Charney) with a background of sexual harassment and general creepiness that would make Charlie Sheen AND Terry Richardson blush. At the same time.

3. Clothes are underwhelming. I've seen plain, monochromatic t-shirts, sweatshirts, and tights at...well, just about any store anywhere. H&M in particular comes to mind, and even thrift stores have clothes like AA's. Heck, sometimes they actually DO have AA stuff.

I know one retail store doesn't always reflect the entire company, but in a multinational retailer like AA, it often does.

I suppose the only downfall would be the price but I think it's totally worth it. Their clothing is so unique and you know there won't be a ton of girls with the same top or dress as you.

I'm not sure how these 22 year old stay at home moms can afford the steep prices, but I'll be damned if this stuff isn't super-feminine and adorable.

Kidding aside, here's my advice for shopping at anthro. Shop the sale area but be aware that their sale prices can still be unreasonable for most people. When I see a belt *reduced* to $100, I kind of want to punch someone. You can find some gems in there though so it's worth taking the time to look. Know that most of the brands that anthro carries tend to vanity size so if you wear a size 14/16/XL, you will still be able to shop here. Sign up for their loyalty card so you can get 15% during your birthday month. That brings me to final bit of advice. Buy the anthro-exclusive AG Stevie jeans! They are the comfiest and most flattering jeans you will ever squeeze into.

Other pluses for anthro: great return policy, electronic receipts, and helpful staff. Maybe it's because this store is in my neighborhood, but I definitely feel more comfortable shopping here than the Scottsdale location.","review","o2CGc1kQHEFkYOECM3NFdg",0,0,0,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Mesa","AZ","Clothing"

Good prices on home goods including bedding and kitchen accessories

Hate:

They constantly push the Kohl's credit card at the register even after you say no

"GicegFT1LZdZnb7JsUT3QA","2014-08-22","yfDcURXsSQwkreGOUNwbxQ",4,"OK, so there are some pros and cons to Kohl's, but if you know how to leverage the store and how it works, you can absolutely get fantastic deals there.

This Kohl's is not particuliarly different from any other.  The racks tend to get a bit sloppy, the service reps are a bit hard to find (especially in the shoe department), and the most popular sizes go quick.  My wife has always struggled a bit to find good things there, but there are plenty of good clothes for kids, decent home goods, and the men's clothes are flat out unbeatable.

Having said all that, here's what you need to do.  First off, get the credit card.  As soon as you do, the sale notices start to come much more frequently.  Secondly, start watchign for the peel-off coupons... and wait for the coupon that is 30% off.  Once you get one of those, check the dates on the flyer and make sure that a decent sale is actually goin on at that time.  Lastly, make sure that not only do they have the kohl's cash available during this particular sale, but make sure that the Kohl's cash usable timeframe OVERLAPS with the sale and the 30% off couon that you got in the mail.  All four of these components line up about 2-3 times a year.  The timeframes that these are usually overlapping and is typically 10-14 days and start on a Friday.

To take full advantage of this alignment of events, I strongly recommend that you go on the first or second day of the sale, especially if that is a Friday.  go in on Friday evening (no one will be there) and you will get first dibs on the best clothes and the most popular sizes because they always stock up right before these sales.  Also, don't hesitate to check the clearance racks, as it is common to find the last of a sportcoat or shirt that was a lead item a couple of months ago on the clearance rack because they only have 4 left of it.  when you get close to finishing and loading up on everything you could possibly want for the year, pick a few things that are lower demand items or things that there are tons of that equal approximately 20% of the total purchase and put them back.  You'll come back for these at the last few days of the sale (when you're allowed to use the Kohl's Cash) and buy those things you left behind.

I know this seems a bit complicated, but we do this and usually go either every 12 to 18 months.  We often spend between $500 and $800 as a family and the list price for the things we buy  are commonly between $1500 and $2400.  We often wind up paying between 30 and 35% of the list price for most items and one particular year we actually spent a total of 25% of the list prices across the whole purchase.  This includes things such as $25 total for dress shoes, $12 for dress shirts, $25 for sport coats, $17 for kakhis, and so on.

If you follow these tips, I am sure (especially if you are after men's clothes) you will be able to get some pretty phenomenal deals and flesh out a respectable wardrobe for a lot less than you thought possible.","review","EosKWs-S3-mN6o_rok_LNQ",0,0,1,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Jewelry,Beauty & Spas,Men's Clothing,Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Chandler","AZ","Clothing"

A) Fit younger gents better than a potato sack

C) Accomplish both A and B without being prohibitively expensive

While you can find pieces here and there that can accomplish those tasks, Banana Republic just delivers those three things with greater consistency than anywhere else I've shopped--Charlotte or otherwise.  

A lot of the dressier stores in Charlotte seem to cater to the preppier crowd.  And by that I mean you can find pastel polo shirts, khakis and loafers on their mannequins in December.  Someone has to supply clothes to all those young adults that wear their Easter best to night clubs!

The woman looked confused...The staff added"" you have items in your hand that looked like they are regular sized, that's why I pointed it out"". OK first of all, YOU DON'T comment on a lady's size!! I mean come on, I feel like I am not freaking petite, but I am in the petite section, you don't know how clothes fit on a person unless you are THAT person trying it on.

What she said was not helpful, if the woman wants to look at the petite items, let her look at them! 

Secondly, all the staffs in this store, well except for the fitting room staff are extremely dead...like not lively. I had to approach people with questions. I see sale signs in select areas with additional 40% off, I asked the girl who was just boringly wandering around if it's just on the items with the sign over them or the whole store, she told me the whole store. She needs to definitely do a better job as the front door greeter, no one knows  this. If i had not asked, I would not have known. Later on, two other woman approached me and asked if I knew what's the deal about the sale and I had to explain it to them. Meaning, the lady at the front is practically useless. 

The staff in the fitting room were quite friendly. Smiled at me the whole time and took their time to introduce themselves. Trying clothes on was the best experience I had in the whole store. 

I don't care how nice your store looks, recently they renovated this store to look like a high end hotel. What I care about is how knowledgeable and helpful your staffs are.

Regardless, while American Apparel is just dandy for a basic (American made) tee of any kind and a smattering of sometimes random gear (sparkly leggings, multi-wear dresses, billowy tops, swimwear, etc.) it doesn't completely satisfy my need to shop in South End. 

The quality of the pieces here is decent, and I'll echo Veronica O's statement that I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for American made products. Expect to pay $20-$30 for a super comfy tee, $30-$50 for a jersey dress, and $10-$15 for accessories like stretchy, vibrant headbands and sustainable water bottles.

They have a pretty large selection of the stuff I see at the regular (non-outlet) stores.  My bf, mom, and I were in there quite awhile browsing the goods.  I left with their black shiny nylon tricot legging for $24 (reg $34) and the cotton spandex sleeveless nightlife dress for $30 (reg $36).  Not too much of a discount, but good enough for me...especially since this stuff isn't too old cuz they're still selling 'em on their website.  The bf also walked away with a few v-necks and thermals.

Minus 1 star because I desperately wanted their shiny leggings in black lame (think pleather) because they were only $32 (reg $42), but the size small was too big. =(  I asked for a x-small, but they didn't have it.  Apparently, it's not the store's fault because the website says that size is unavailable.

My rule of thumb: you must look through every nook and cranny when inspecting these garments. These are reject items that weren't good enough for the regular AA. You might have bought a legging or slim slack with a massive hole in the crotch area. Or there might be a small stain on your just bought shirt. Try on the clothing if you're unsure, sizing in the AA outlet is bizarre at times. A medium pullover felt like an XL one time.

Once you get past the nonchalant, complacent, hipster employees, customer service is spotty at best. The best time to go is a weekday morning or afternoon. I've received the best service during this time. Avoid weekends! The place is packed with people (especially tourists) that hog the dressing rooms.

AA provides an endless supply of short shorts and sheer tops for enthusiasts of freedom and classic American styling alike. Not to mention their minimum factory worker pay rate of $12 dollars an hour, and company-wide advocacy initiatives on issues such as immigration rights and tolerance.

Yes, there are some nude female models on the website. I'm not sure why this is considered ""overtly sexual"" by some, as I feel the site tries to convey the message of expression through fashion, and embracing ALL wonderful things that come with being young.

I love, love, love their clothes! Although I appreciate the comfort and utility of brands such as Juicy Couture (also American-made), and Ralph Lauren. I overall disapprove of label whoring.

The store is pretty similar to other Forever 21 stores... everyone there.. just LOOKS like they shop at Forever 21, if you know what I mean. The floor staff is really friendly. Like over-zealous friendly. Bordering on scary friendly, but always around waiting to be helpful. There are two full floors of merchandise, including the new plus-size line Faith 21. This is one of about 15 places around the country that are launching the line, which is actually why I headed up to Arrowhead in the first place. (includes XL, 1X, 2X sizes) This is really a nice feature, because there are few places that actually sell trendy plus size clothing, and even fewer that are this affordable! Forever 21 actually has about 5 or 6 different brands under their name, including a men's line and a ""contemporary"" line, all of which this store carries, so the variety is greater than at their other smaller stores. 

Added conveniences at this location are several fitting rooms on both floors, as well as restrooms, a huge accessory area- all benefits of turning a department store space into one giant teen/twentysomething girl's dream.  Last things to keep in mind- accessories, which will inevitably break after a few times-but hey, they're cheap- are still non-refundable. Also, they no longer give refunds, which I wasn't aware of, only store credit.","review","5wN78N4K0a39C-uPzPmxDw",3,3,4,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Glendale","AZ","Clothing"

I told her, TRUTHFULLY, that all the other shirts of that style had also been on the clearance rack, so either it was on clearance or all of those shirts had been ""misplaced."" She sent another one of the girls to check, and this girl just said ""No, those shirts aren't on clearance.""
The cashier just smirked at me, but I decided to just pay the money she asked for rather than argue. In hindsight, I should have gone over to the rack and shown them that it was marked clearance, proving that they were lying.
I got out my wallet to get my money, and I had exactly $8 in cash, but no change. I told the girl I was however-many-cents short, expecting that she would do as all cashiers in my hometown do and tell me that it's no problem, don't worry about it, they'll cover it.

Lets start with the environment, it is absolutely the most disgusting store I have been in, I have been to cleaner stores in Tijuana! The carpets remind me of a seedy pay by the hour hotel as does the walls, counters, etc.... The dressing rooms alone do not give you that ""Please let me take my clothes off and try on these awesome jeans"" feel; you do however get a "" I may raped, mugged or something else that would inflict much bodily harm"" feel!

The staff are great and they are not to blame for any of this companies problems, although FOREVER 21 you may want to actually listen to your employees because I for one know that they feel the same way!

With that being said lets move on to why I decided to write this; the absolutely atrocious policy this store attempts to inflict on its ""Customers""! I have never ever been to an establishment other than an music store that tells its customers they have 21 days to return or exchange the item, I am guessing someone in their meager policy/marketing department must have thought that was cute. But then to tell your customers that even if returned in that 21 day time frame they will receive store credit and not a cash refund. Excuse me but with the sub par clothing and prices that should be a crime why in the world would I want a store credit to buy more junk? Probably to ensure that they have very little on their P/L sheets every quarter!

I decided to take my wife bikini shopping, she found a cute one, it was the last one, so to ensure she got it we decided to buy it and if she found something better we would return it. Well after a couple more stores and couple more bikini purchases she decided that it really wasn't all that flattering and decided to take it back. This is where we were told that we could have a store credit but not a refund! After advising them that I had been in there not more the 20 minutes prior and purchased it in cash I decided it was quite pointless as the ""manager"" could not be found and the store associates were not in a position to change this lackluster policy, I decided to write this post and take my business elsewhere.

One girl was helping me and the BF to check stock of a dutch oven I was considering. They didn't have a lot of the colors out since it was on clearance so she went to go check their warehouse stock and went to find me to let me know that she can order exactly what we want and have it shipped to our home for free. They were so sweet about looking up stuff and kept telling us don't settle if the right color makes us happy. 

I had a question about a sign for 40% off as it was right next to the Kitchen Aid mixers but was very vague so between the girl helping us and her manager they were able to work it out. So glad we asked! I almost didn't as I thought no way would a Kitchen Aid mixer ever go on mega sale and it probably means just the hand mixer sitting on the same table. They applied it to a mixer so I was sold and got the nicer, Architect series. Plus there was a rebate for a free attachment of a glass bowl or meat grinder so I'm getting a $60 grinder too! Then the ladies got us to open up a Macy's card so we saved 10% more off instantly then 20% gets skimmed off our cards balance for purchases made today and tomorrow. 

Oh, and I had a exchange to skim off another $90. 

So a Kitchen Aid mixer, a Martha Stewart 7qt dutch oven and Waterford Marquis crystal glass set and we were out only $150 instead of their $700 value.

Their clothes are just as cheap as what you would find at Forever 21, but at least Forever 21 charges the appropriate prices for what they sell.

Oh, yeah.  My family buys us stuff at Macy's all the time and sometimes I need to return it.

If you're lucky, you can find decent deals on shoes and kitchen stuff.  That's all I've really noticed.

For this Macy's in particular, the clothing areas are always chaotic messes and there is zero customer service.  The shoe department is cleaner, but they get easily overwhelmed as they are short-staffed.  The kitchen section is usually well-put together and easy to navigate and the customer service is the best here out of all the departments.

He didn't even bother to search for it on the computer, he just casually looked through the glass display and after looking through about 3 cases said that he couldn't find it so that meant that they didn't have any left.

After she found that they in fact did not have the ring in stock, she turned me over to a different worker. Before she walked away she clearly said to both me and the worker that I would receive free shipping and 25% off. After she walked away I was given the 25% off, but then charged $10 for shipping. I had already wasted a lot of time in the store so I agreed to pay for shipping and requested for it to be sent to my house. I then *clearly* stated that I wanted a size 7 ring.
She charged my card and I left the store, already disappointed in the service I received.

I arrived home about an hour later and checked my email for a confirmation of the purchase they had done for me. Once I opened the email I saw that she had ignored what I told her about being a size 7 and needing the standard ring size. My order was for a ring size 8, which will not fit my finger.

I felt someone staring at me and noticed that a gentlemen was half way across the area watching our every move like we were stealing our being suspicious. (Note that my girlfriend and I had no bags, purses, or baggy clothing whatsoever.) I told my girlfriend we are being watched again. She got upset but thought I was joking. As we made our way to the escalator, we passed the appliance area. The same gentlemen that was staring at me stood no more than 5ft away from us. We both had nothing in our hands. I looked in the clearance area of the appliances and the employee felt it necessary to walk right next to me, stand and pretend to look or count a display merchandise setup. My girlfriend stood array from me and watch the guy watch me. I felt extremely uncomfortable. I understand trying to prevent theft and being cautious, but I felt their loss prevention staff and employees were going too far. As my girlfriend and I were leaving, she even felt uncomfortable and was irritated at the actions and behaviors these employees were doing. 
Again, being apart of the loss prevention team, I understand how things work and what employees and customers do. But to make my shopping experience that uncomfortable was uncalled for. I hope this was merely an isolated incident and it doesn't happen to every customer who is a true paying customer.","review","LHBSbrthd-58uCO9NFqfRg",0,0,0,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Okay, I chose a watch that was on a display table, it was to be a gift. There was no one in sight in the jewelry area, so I brought it up to the second floor. The woman at the customer service register refused to allow me to make my purchase. She sent me back down to the jewelry area to make my purchase. 

I went back down to the third level, where one woman was working. Unfortunately, she was dealing with someone who was buying a watch that needed to be sized. Now, there was myself and another gentleman who wanted to purchase something and be done with it. The woman working on the watch called for assistance. After about five minutes someone came over to ring up my watch. 

I am just wondering, what if I wanted something from each of the three floors. Would I have to purchase linens in one floor, clothes on another, and jewelry on yet another? Really? Makes no sense.

Urban, for me, has always been the place where I go to buy nice clothing for special occasions, or to hit the sales racks when I am feeling like some new tops or dresses. I rarely ever will pay full price for anything there.

Honestly, most of their clothing is cute, but all of it is overpriced at full retail. And considering the City Scape's location has nearly nothing discounted, I have ceased to shop there.

Downtown Phoenix is growing, and that's awesome--but they wonder why the higher-end businesses don't do as well. The business and arts district are filled with students and young professionals who don't have a ton of money to spend on clothes.

so i ask ""d"" if they have this other shoe and apparently they have it in a 12.  I ask: ""do those shoes happen to run large at all?""  Him: ""Um. They come in up to a size 13, we just don't have it.""  Right.  I make a sufficiently pained expression and say that i will try on the size 12 just in case.

Before he gets to getting me the size 12 shoe, he starts tying the tie on this waifish, pubescent kid who can only be conflicted in all the most crucial ways, including how high on one's ass pants should be worn.  My wife seethes at this, because he just stopped helping us to work on this other guy.  She wants to leave and go to another Macy's.  I opt to just pick up my next potential purchase and bang the soles together, to her immense consternation.

So she goes on and walks around because she can't handle this guy's impudence.  I decide to walk over to where the blind is leading the blind and leer, just to get my point across.  It ultimately works.  I get my shoes.  That's most of the story.

Except that while I was paying, ""d"" asked if I was thinking of upgrading my wardrobe anytime soon.  Humility, to be sure.

(Wife: ""I was kind of angry.  He just kind of left us there and started helping someone else, like we were nothing.""  As you can see, she is worked up.)","review","vhAn390OgR1H4DwacJdc7w",6,10,8,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

 Note, I've never had an issue with any past orders.  We split the order, as I paid for one piece with my credit card, and the other with cash.  One piece was stated that it was in stock ,and the other would need to be ordered.  I received a call that the orders were ready for delivery about six weeks later.  Because of a move, I ended up I rescheduled the delivery to my new place.  This is where it goes down hill fast on a sled--yikes.  I had a move in scheduled on Saturday to my new place by 9am.  Two days before the delivery I receive information the window is from 815-1015am.

  I called customer service to see if I could be moved down the delivery window, as I would not be able to have access to the new place until 9am.  I was told no I would have to reschedule.  This cost me an additional days rent as I did not want to reschedule.  So Saturday morning arrives.  The delivery men were friendly, and told me I needed to take a look at the items.

  Multiple issues--one piece was a different color than the other.  The item that was the correct color had been damaged in shipping and also had a factory defect in it.  So the delivery men told me that Macys would call me.  Me thinks not- as this delivery experience was leaving a terrible taste in my mouth.  I showed up at the store next day asking for a department manager.  I then had a useless associate say she could try to help, and then when I described what had taken place she stated she could not.  I went to another store to look at other pieces, as I figured it could only go further south.  I found something at Z Gallerie and then went back to Macys to talk with the department manager.

  I was told if I wanted a new shipment it would be another 5 weeks, but was not offered any concessions due to their error.  I was also told I would have to wait 2 weeks for my cash refund.  I received a call from the manager that they cancelled the ordered on the 7th and my refund was processing.  I called today the 17th to customer service and was told my check was sent 02/10 from Florida.  Disgusting.  I don't think I will be doing business with Macys furniture again and if I do, it will only be on credit or debit card as my credit card was not charge for merchandise not received.

I am writing this review based on the Men's Wear department. Absolutely amazing. 

Recently, I started a new job, and it was time to get a new wardrobe. I came into some cash, so I figured why not splurge a little.

I bought a suit, some slacks, and a bunch of dress shirts in this round of shopping. The remarkable note here is that the staff is VERY friendly and HELPFUL.

They aren't just cashiers. They know how to properly measure you for your clothing, make recommendations on what looks good, and give you suggestions on what is properly fitted and what isn't.

I nearly bought a jacket that was two sizes too big because it felt ""comfortable"" and it was my old size (thank God I've been working out"". The new jacket size actually is WAY more flattering and I look like a G in it.

Helpful tip: If the sizings work for you, buy as many of the DKNY and Calvin Klein dress shirts as you can because these designers tend to keep changing their cuts.

(Turned out that the ""gift w/ purchase"" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy's turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy's rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn't long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I'd just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.  

The original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she'd looked at another product's tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I'd let it go, and left Macy's.  

I returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona's heat and break off.  (I don't have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).

See Macy's?  If you didn't make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I'd have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I'm not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product's line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I'm making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy's, I'll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I'll just spend my money at Dillard's and Sephora.","review","0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ",5,5,7,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

However, I must say the women's/misses dept customer service is not the same. I was making a purchase of several blouses, all on clearance and a very good prices only to have one of the blouses ring up as zero - it was no longer a stocked item so the price was not registering. When I asked the sales clerk what was up she responded that she would fix it so the sale and clearance price would be applied. She ended up taking another item that was $6 dollars more and ringing it up 2x saying that after the extra % off if would be cheaper??? I don't think so, she started tell me that she was doing me a favor and I really was gettting a deal. 

My biggest pet peeve is how can anyone in retail not know simple percentages i.e. 10%, 20% 25% etc? I ended up walking out and sadly have not returned since then.

Biltmore Fashion Square has fabulous clearance as well but I can honestly say their staff is not helpful at all.

My mom bought me these diamond hoop earrings for Xmas and I took them to exchange for a pair of diamond earrings. The sales lady was nice (kinda pressured me..but in a nice way..she dealt with all my going back and forth). Ultimately, I opted for some diamond earrings that were on clearance (they were still $400 so it's not like I'm not droppin bills). The lady convinces me to buy the extended warranty specifically saying that it covers my earrings being converted into screwbacks - a necessity for earrings. So I finally said okay. I told her I'd bring them back to get them done since I wanted to wear them on New Years and my bday. 

So I take them in last week and the ladies working the counter were nice enough to help me out. I'm pretty sure she even confirmed that my earrings would be taken care of FREE of charge since I already purchased the extended warranty. 

Fast forward to today. Joyce calls me (I'm not sure if she's the one who took my earrings when I came in to get them serviced) to tell me she has an estimate. What?  Estimate for what? My earrings?!?!?! Well apparently Macys will only cover the screwbacks if the earrings are over $1,500. Why the F didn't anyone tell me that before? So no. I don't want to pay $130 for my earrings to be serviced. I'm sure I can find somewhere far less expensive to get them done. Oh wait, so now I'm not going to have my earrings back for another week. FUCKING A. I'm beyond irritated. 

Macys has been steadily declining over the years and this has just been the icing on the cake. This is why I will always shop at Nordstrom.

You see, back in the day we had so many choices among the big department stores: Goldwater's, I. Magnin, Marshall Field's, Filenes, Bullock's, Bon Marché, Abraham & Straus, and John Wanamaker's. These are some great names, who are now all gone, replaced by a super store called Macy's.

At Fashion Square, we have Dillard's, Nordstrom's, and Needless Markup (er, Neiman Marcus).  They are the best of the remaining big box retail anchors.

Macy's to it's credit, has the size to squeeze suppliers, offering some good value to consumers. But Macy's is a shell of it's former self.  Thanks to the bankruptcy in the early 90's, it began a consolidation phase into one brand.  It also brought about a bland  homogeneous sameness.  

I miss the old brands and the former Macy's. But the new one has some good prices and occasionally a great sale.  So, if do don't mind the same old same old, then this is your place.

This location receives three stars instead of four because of their customer service.

If you used the iPhone app or FB touch site you could unlock a special coupon when you check-in at the store.  To kick-off the program the deal had to be great... and it was. The first 10,000 customers got a free pair of jeans.

So what that I'm on vacation?! I sure as hell ran right over to Caesar's Palace to score this deal.  When I got there they only had 3 coupons left, so I was very happy.

That was easy part. The hard part was trying to decide what to get.  It's been years since I've bought Gap jeans.  According to them they've come a long way and are more stylish than before.  I'm not so sure that much has changed except adding a ""wash"" to make the denim look like it hadn't been washed.

Anyway, I returned later that afternoon and someone came to help me after he saw that I was staring blankly at the wall of jeans.  He gave a brief explanation of a few things and whisked me back to the dressing room with a few options to try. In addition to a few boot cut and standard men's jeans, he also suggested some women's styles.  I have zero interest in wearing women's clothes, but I tried them on anyway.  Believe it or not, he was right about them looking pretty good. Unfortunately the pockets are really shallow and I just didn't see myself wearing them very much.

In the end I left with a dark blue pair of 1969 Boot jeans and a smile on my face.

I live down the road and since I was a child I had never heard of Kohl's.  And when came in down the road, it was described to me as a cross between a Dillard's and a Mervyn's.  This didn't bode well for this new establishment. I was pretty sure I was going to buy socks, and maybe underwear here, and call it a deal. Boy, was I wrong.

The first time I knew I was missing out is when my wife bought me a bunch of clothes (yeah, my wife buys some of my clothes. I admit it) and I started wearing them and they weren't just very affordable, they were also very much my style. Casual, generic, and comfortable beyond all description. I had to know what this place looked like in person. It had to have tossed clothing racks, rancid dressing rooms, horrible service. DAMN! Foiled again. 

Now, I am writing this review about 5 years after this place has been around so this is about 4 years of experiences at this location. The racks are always, for the most part, clean and tidy. The organization is methodical and predictable. The clothes are a very good bargain. I am not talking super high end stuff for a good price. I am talking proprietary clothing at an outstanding price. Generic silk screen shirts, sturdy jeans, quality socks. This isn't Rodeo drive people, but they do have some nicer clothes that I have purchased for interviews and weddings. Good clothing, period.

This brings me to the price. I guess I don't know the first thing about running a large chain of retail clothing. I will admit this. But how can you throw down $150 worth of clothing on the check out counter and after red tags, special discount days, mailed coupons, Arbor Day, and just because discounts, I am paying around $85. I don't think Kohl's sells surplus clothing like Costco and Sam's but if it is then I truly can't tell. And however they do it, I don't care. The prices is how this store earned that extra star on the end. I will go back for pretty much everything short of suits and scuba gear.

I can't end this without talking about the staff. Always friendly and knowledgeable. The returns are lenient if you just are happy with your purchase. They will give you a little good conversation while you are checking out and they really keep the store in good shape overall.

Asked about the return policy since this item was a gift and were told ""they never care, you can return it whenever."" Seemed like an odd answer, but we'll take it - no offer or a gift receipt or anything else. 

Not a bad stop, but not the best location for this chain that we've been to. Definitely a three star, ""A-OK"" spot.","review","X7dxykmIV9LL5ZxLtgQYXA",0,0,0,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Jewelry,Beauty & Spas,Men's Clothing,Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Peoria","AZ","Clothing"

We went in with a specific price range in mind and a general idea of what we were looking for in a suit.  Neither of us has had a lot of experience with buying a suit or being fitted for one.  Ivan was the salesperson assigned to us and he was incredibly helpful.  He listened well to what we wanted and was able to make accommodations as requested.  When we gave him a price range, he adapted the styles easily and without any judgment.  There was no hard-sell or anything like that.  He was attentive and the suggestions he made were great.  It was clear that Ivan has a passion for a good suit and it showed in the selections he made.

He helped get the suit fitted and altered and explained every itemized detail on the receipt without having to be asked.  He was not overly gregarious and there was never a sense that he was working for his commission.  At several points, he needed to help other clientele but it was done with impeccable manners and we were never left waiting.

This is a store we would return to and Ivan is a salesman we would work with again.  

Minus one star for cleanliness.  Not all of the workers were dressed as impeccably as Ivan and as representatives of tailored suits for men, it seems apropos that the employees would set the example.  Additionally, it was clear that the carpets were not clean and several of the displays were not as crisp as they could have been.

"ITgHcPGmiGBochqwNdVhVQ","2012-11-13","JCJl2xn1xXE0NvkjjbnSdg",2,"I stopped here a few years ago to buy some jeans... at the time, this location was carrying 7 for All Mankind, which was a pleasant surprise.  I remember going in, browsing the selection, buying a pair of jeans and leaving without much effort.

Fast-forward four years...

I enter the store and am greeted immediately by someone who is eager to help.  I ask if they have any 7 for All Mankind and am told they don't carry that line any longer, but they do have several other brands, and they're all on sale.  Since I was already there (and because I have a quality denim addiction) I decided to browse.

Only, I couldn't browse.  No sir; I was swarmed by three - count 'em - three sales people the entire time.  Now, they were all very helpful, but it's a bit unnerving to have three people following you around showing you jean after jean after jean, asking questions, asking if you need anything else like shirts, sweaters, sport coats, ties, socks, shoes, etc.  

I decided to try on a few pair; why they thought I'd like skinny jeans is beyond me... each pair I tried was so tight in the leg (I ride bikes, run, and swim) that I couldn't fit a few of them past my knee.  

I mentioned this several times, yet each subsequent pair they presented was ""skinny"" cut.  I finally asked for a ""traditional"" or ""relaxed"" jean, and wouldn't you know it, but I could actually pull them up past my knees.  I settled on a single pair of (mediocre; pedestrian quality) jeans, which weren't on sale, but oh well.

The thing that irked me the most was the checkout process... ""Would you like to join our rewards club?""  

Me: ""No thanks.  I shop here about once a year.""

Them: ""It's free and you earn points with each purchase.  Why don't you try it?""

Me: ""No thanks.""

Them: ""Ok, can we get your name?""

Me: (tell them my name)

Them: ""Oh, you're in our system!  You must have rented here before?  Ok, well, we'll just add you to the rewards club, and then you'll be all set.  Are you still at this address?  And is this your phone number?  And is this your e-mail?""

Me: ""Not interested, please don't register me.  And, yes - that info is correct, but please don't sign me up.""

Them: ""Ok, here you go - oh, wait - your e-mail shows as invalid.  Are you sure this is your e-mail address?""

Me: ""I really don't want to get any of your e-mail or mailings.""

Them: ""Ok, we'll just override the verification.  Ok, you're all set!""

I arrived home, checked my receipt and I'll be danged if they didn't register me for their stupid ""Perfect Fit"" program.  Worse yet, I received a ""welcome to the club"" e-mail from good 'ole George Zimmer himself.

To describe the whole situation in short: I went to the store to buy a vest, one consultant referred me to another, I waited to be serviced for 20 minutes, because the ladies were making service calls and thought I was waiting for someone/something else (?). Finally I've purchased the vest and paid for expedited delivery ($70). Next day I came to pick it up and to find out I paid for a rental! I started discussing the subject with staff - I couldn't go get a vest somewhere else now because this was the day of the event I needed it for. Nothing but blank faces, clueless, not knowing how to react. The sales person who I made the ""purchase"" from only said - ""what do you want me to do now?"" Finally someone came - probably manager and said that we can pretend I lost the vest and for extra $60 I can keep it.... $130 vest???

Just went online today to file a complaint. To file via email they only provide an online form. When I filled out the form and pushed the submit button, I've received an error message saying - Service not available...what? Tried with different browsers, figured - maybe my complaint is too long, tried to shorten it, talked to Live Service - of course NO HELP!

Normally I think JCP is good around Christmas. They always have amazing sales and you can find really cheap kids toys here strangely enough, such as RC cars and helicopters. You can also find good stocking stuffers, especially for the older people in your family. I have also noted I can find cheap running shoes here as well.

As for their clothes selection I never find anything I like. Their junior/petites section definitely does not speak to me and the clothes, to me, all look pretty cheap and junky. I rarely find anything I like.

They do have a decent small appliances/kitchen section and if you get their catalogs/sales in the mail you can often find a pretty dang good deal on certain things. This past Black Friday I got 24 Lock-N-Lock storage containers for $19.99. Very cheap. 

This particular JCP is lacking in customer service most of the time and often I find that the customer service people have problems running coupons or being able to point out where the deals that are being offered in the catalog are. Management could do their store a favor by training on the weekly/daily deals a little better.

First, it was incredibly difficult to find! All the employees I asked kept saying ""it is in the back right corner,"" which it is, but it was still incredibly hard to find. It's tucked in a little corner next to the salon, but you can only see the ""portrait"" sign if you are coming directly at it. If you are coming through the guy's section, you have to turn right once you hit the salon, but there are no overhead signs for it. 

When I went in precisely at my appointment time (12.20), the photographer was still finishing up with the people ahead of me. Having worked in a medical office for many years, I didn't mind, as I know that one person who's late can set your entire day back. However, a couple showed up just after me, and they said their appointment was at 12.30. That seems awfully tight to me.

I felt really rushed - the photographer shot 9 pictures total with 2 backgrounds. There's no mirror to check your hair or makeup in. The pictures came out ""fine"" and I didn't need anything fancy - just a few head & shoulders shots for applications.

Afterwards though, I stood in line for 5-6 mins and stepped out of line to look at the clearance rack next to the other register.  When I was done, another lady stepped in line on the side I was previously standing on so I stepped in line on the other side.  So we were standing in line for about 10 mins and the lady working the register in the line I'm in, looks up at the other lady and tells her she'll be right with her.  That lady pointed at me to acknowledge me.  The lady, the assistant manager, Tammy looked at the other lady and said, ""they like to sneak in like that"".  


Rude!!!  You should never talk about customers in front of them.  NEVER.


Shows how much she pays attention to her surroundings, considering I had been in line pretty much for 15-20 patiently waiting for them to finish.   How she made it to an Assistant Manager is beyond me.  Poor customer service and colorful choice of conversations to have with her co-worker with customers standing in front of her.","review","BbSQ7MSYlyDE5WmRu_adnw",0,0,0,"Gap","Fashion,Shopping,Sporting Goods,Men's Clothing,Women's Clothing,Sports Wear","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

No one cares and customers don't matter
Here's my email.

I just had one of the worst experiences in a Mens Wearhouse ever and thats why I'm sending an email. This has frustrated me all of yesterday and still is.

I moved to Las Vegas from Missouri.  Shopped at your Springfield store many times for years and have bought many slacks, shirts, suits and walked away very happy.  I'm in sales and I know what keeping a customer means to me. 

  Yesterday I  went to Store No. 2401  1159 E Twain Las Vegas.  My wife and I went in for slacks and shirts for my work.  We were greeted by  a gentleman named Marcus, who was a very helpful guy.  He took me to the area of slacks.   I explained what i was looking for and he shared with me the great sale going on.   Talked up the sales sign where it clearly states if I buy 3 pairs of slacks they would be $45 a piece.  Great lets get started.    I picked out a few shirts as well.   I was trying many slacks and shirts on.  Finally finding the perfect set of 3. Trying everything on and getting fitted for a HOUR and 1/2 wore me out but I thought it was going to be worth it in the end.

I was so wrong.  I went to checkout and then this is where it got insulting and made me upset.
 I guess that 2 of the slacks were not the sale price but a different slack and were $90 a piece.
So a manager named Joyce came over and said ""if you noticed the price and see that these slacks are better quality slack theres no way we can sell them for $45 and I would get fired if I did""  Again Im in sales and I've been trained to pick up verbiage and tone in voices.  The way she came across was very insulting.  I was freaking fuming.  Here I am on my day off which my wife had planned out the whole day for us and I talked her into going to Mens Wearhouse for just a few minutes.   

Here's my problem     The time I took trying many shirts and slacks on and getting the slacks fitted.  Thinking that I would be walking out the door with 3 pairs of slacks and the 3 shirts.  The way it was handled was HORRIBLE, the way i was talked down to  because i wasn't buying the better quality of slacks.  I couldn't tell difference in slacks.   Thats not my job to know these things.  IT'S YOURS!!!  ITS NOT MY FAULT.     If I took a client and had him spend an hour and a 1/2 with my product and I bragged about the wonderful sale and the deal he was getting and when it was time to ring up the order I told him sorry YOU CAN'T have it.  Holy crap.    If that mistake was made, I would have honored the deal knowing that he will be back for years to come.  Lose a little, but gain a lot.  The biggest part of sales business is Word Of Mouth.  I work with 63 salesmen (MEN)  Do  you realize that business and the competition  there is in Las Vegas?  Not only have you lost me as a repeat costumer but a chance for referral business.  I'm going to give my opinions about TMW when I get back to work.      

The point is not about me paying $90 each for the 2 slacks, I went ahead and bought the 3 shirts and one pair of slacks because I didn't want to go drag my wife to another place and have to start the process over again and be even more wore out trying crap on again.  Now I have to do this over again at another time.  I'm pissed about that.   The point is.... i was promised a deal and took the time to get it.  It wasn't delivered.  I was talked down to and insulted.  You guys took something away from me that I thought i was getting.  It was a let down.  You guys should have lost a little to gain a lot.  You would have gained way more than a loss of probably a measly $100 for you.  It's not acceptable. 

Sincerely, one lost customer that does't know the difference between the quality of the 2 sale slacks.

p.s. i never left the fitting room and never took a pair of slacks off the rack off the rack, the 7 slacks that I tried on were brought to me.","review","zJyawQSC7ySRu0W5sjBPPQ",0,0,1,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

This store is definitely much more chilled and less busier than the other UO located at the Miles Shop. 

Out of all UO's I've been too, I really did enjoy this store. Granted that it's Las Vegas, so they definitely have to up-keep this store. There's also an amazing sale section in the back that is actually organized! There aren't any clothes lying on the floor. Nothing is cluttered in the store. 

I even got a BDG shirt for only 5 bucks!

I am absolutely not okay with a fringed t-shirt costing $35.00 and being one size fits all. I was on the verge of going into a tirade about fabrics and cost but I've decided to simplify it to two words: obscenely overpriced. 

I ended up snagging a pretty decent over sized tee from the sale rack for $10 and buying my husband a Gibson Les Paul tee but I'm going to have to return or exchange his tee because the fit is a bit strange. I'll give Urban one more try but I'll definitely visit the one in the Miracle Mile because it's twice as large and thus the sale racks are twice as plentiful. 2 stars because the people who work there were quite pleasant, helpful, and actually offered me to start a dressing room when they saw me holding 6 hangers!

We went in and they had very many white as well as many other dresses in stock and I found a few (no sales staff to be seen) and went into the dressing room by myself to try them on.  Well, the sizes weren't quite right so I got dressed and went back out and got some different sizes.  

Well, in the meantime the room I was using was full and I had, had trouble zipping the zippers on the last dress so I selected a room that had some clothes in it (that normally happens so I didn't think too much about it) and asked the YS to come into the room to help zip me as I was getting no help from anyone else.  Well, as we shut the door, a staffer who apparently was originally from Russia, said with quite an accent ,no that room is reserved you can go over there and pointed to another side where there were more rooms and then said pointing to the YS you have to wait outside.

So, I was steamed at that point and went in to try it on.  I didn't love it and even if I did I didn't want to give them my money so I hung it up and walked out.

I won't be back.","review","nUHHk3cmr4ia7u36YMZTtw",1,1,1,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Probably one of the few department stores from my childhood  (Emporium Capwell's, Mervyn's, Montgomery Ward- all gone; there's still Sears, but the general style of clothing is a little outdated compared to Kohl's or even JCP) that I still like going to- why didn't I write up a review a lot sooner?! 

Had a birthday gift card burning a hole in my pocket, and wanted to get some makeup goodies at the MAC counter. And that is exactly what I did, yes, ladies, the Mac counter takes Macy's gift cards. Used a gift card here twice, in fact- had one earlier in the year (a very convenient location from work to home- closest one to home, actually). 

Not the biggest Macy's store here, Meadows might be a tad bigger, with 3 floors, but I prefer this one to the one at the Galleria in Henderson- my least favorite Macy's store (don't think that this one has a MAC counter either, because the MAC counter is in the Dillards across the way). The most frequented Macy's store for me is at the Boulevard Mall- love the jewelry counter's clearance racks. Getting back to this location, this one does have a nice cosmetics counter, shoe department, and a MAC counter. Supposed to be opening a Macy's Men Store sometime but I've seen the sign up forever. 

Macy's always has one day sales, and coupons (savings pass) in the newspaper or online. And Macy's always has styles that are current and relevant. I really like the Macy's stores in Oahu too, BTW.","review","XjfKBr96h6GgrfkR_q6gIA",0,0,0,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Macy's is currently under renovation to make way for a separate department division right across, entirely for men. Sections have been closed off to spread out whatever's left of women's lines so expect the second floor to be occupied with women's clothing as well (plus teenagers and children) 

This is always a must-stop around Memorial Day, post-Christmas, Thanksgiving and any important holiday really. Why? Clearance. Yes, 65% off original prices and 30% off already reduced prices. Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren price tags go down as low as $14 a shirt - not bad for high quality clothing. 

Clearance shoe racks are arranged according to size and prices range from $10-$80-ish (mind you, these are designer brands) Only downside is if you're a size 6 and find a great pair at size 9, chances are the store won't have stock for your size left. Still, I would trade designer brands any day (not like I'm really into them in the first place) for affordable prices and you can't go wrong with that.","review","H1tN4ITtiMj3UH83OSviiw",0,0,1,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

If you're on holiday there then make sure you go to the visitor center which is on floor 1 1/2 and get an 10% off card for all out of state visitors. You may have to take your driving license or passport to prove you're a visitor to Las Vegas.

I have shopped at many Macy's Department stores in various cities.
I find this store to be my favorite.
The manage Rhonda Lawrence is a terrific manager and her employees as well
as customers love her.  The Sales personnel are wonderful, especially
Rayna Morris in housewares.  I am a senior and always looking for ways to save money.  Rayna has helped me with sales coupons on many of my purchases .
Also Pauline in the Women's ware department.  They both know me by name
and know what I like .  It is such a  pleasure to find most of my needs at this Macy's.
I find I save more on purchases there, then in stores like Target, K-Mart or
Walmart.

It had been YEARS since we've done a professional family portrait for Christmas so with Groupon offering such an amazing deal, I couldn't pass it up. The studio waiting area is fairly roomy considering the amount of people packed in bright and early on Black Saturday. The employees were all friendly and cheerful. We were taken right on time for our photos. Our photographer was EXCELLENT. She asked great questions about what we were looking for in background, poses, and ""theme"". She had a way with the kids and got the baby to smile every single time. Our pictures looked great. The young man helping me select our portraits for our package was helpful, patient, and gave great suggestions without being pushy. He didn't try to get me to buy more than I was comfortable with and he was very patient while I picked out our photos. Our photos were ready about a week later and pick up was easy and pain-free.

The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because this studio is EXPENSIVE. Had I not had a Groupon, our bill would have easily been over $400 on portraits and still wouldn't have gotten the photo CD as that was even pricier. Even with the Groupon I still spent $160 on my own. 

All in all this was an excellent experience and I will definitely consider JCPenney Portrait Studio again in the future, but I admit that I might balk a little simply because of the price.","review","kG8jkVFgOAOq6Ht6RvAjEQ",0,0,1,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Glendale","AZ","Clothing"

I received a gift session and I was more than happy to get my daughter's first Christmas cards done. It was a mad house from the second we stepped into the studio.

I understand it's the holiday season; I get it..really I do. But booking a session at a certain time, should fall within that time-give or take 10-15 minutes. NOT 90 minutes after that time.

I had a 5 month old infant with me..and lets say she wasn't happy sitting around, waiting for 90 minutes, to get a very sour, overworked, and probably really tired photographer.

No guidance, no instruction or attempts by this person to work with my kid. Plop child on this dot, snap picture. Yes my daughter was fussy..but YOU guys were late..what happens? I ask if I can feed her, only to learn, that our slot has been taken and we have to wait again. WHAT?!

Now, our second photographer was a thousand times better which is why I added another star. He really did all he could to get our daughter to smile without seeming angry or bored, or upset. But like I said, 90 minutes with a child waiting, and your not going to get a happy baby in pictures. The person who then tries to pick poses and templates with you was just not...professional. She was suggesting the most horrid pictures possible. Nightmare!

I stuck around because it was a gift, and I was not going to be ungrateful, but I will not be using this studio ever again.","review","EeSBXLMh3CvjSqBpJWT9gw",0,0,0,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Glendale","AZ","Clothing"

I have been a consistent shopper of Urban since my college days at U of A. At first, it was because the U of A campus only had limited stores for me to shop within walking distance of my dorm. Then they became the store with a strong variety of dresses and perfect gag gifts and off the beaten path knick knacks. When I finished college and moved to Phoenix, I would do the occasional visit if I was on Mille. But then when they opened up a store at the Waterfront, I was sold and came to the conclusion that I could still enter without feeling too old. 

Moving on the Urban, it's part of the Anthropologie chain so if you like the look of Anthro but can't quick make it to their prices, you can visit Urban where the clothing is similar but a bit trendier and cheaper. They have the best gag gifts out there including inappropriate ones sitting right next to the game you haven't played since you were eight. And since some of the shoppers are eight, then this is their haven. The clothes are funky and fun. You can go the traditional route or you can get as trendy as you want in just one visit. They have adorable shoes and accessories and I love the housing decorations they sell. 

Urban is a great store to visit when looking to make a whimsical purchase, find a deal on some clothes (they have awesome sales), purchase a trendy outfit or simply browse and waste some time when it's too hot to stand outside.","review","4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ",6,3,7,"Urban Outfitters","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Home & Garden,Men's Clothing,Women's Clothing","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

I carefully walked towards the back of the store and found the men's section only to be greeted by a gigantic sale rack! It was amazing. I picked up three pairs of jeans, and a killer cardigan for 65 bucks. Everything fit perfect.

All their stores are out in the outlying areas of the Valley. Maybe with one of the vacant Mervyn's stores(which I'll miss) they'll open up one in the middle of Phoenix. (hint, hint) 

Anyway, like someone else mentioned in an earlier review Kohl's seems to ALWAYS be having a sale of some kind or another. Which is good. 

This store is kind of tucked away...really not easily seen from the street. All the businesses in the parking lot seem to be blocking the store. 

Once you're inside you'll find a clean and well organized store. ( I have been there before but tonight you could tell it was a little picked over due to the holiday shopping season.) Took my time shopping and really did the entire store. Found a lot of great sales and got a lot of Christmas shopping done. 

If you have a Kohl's credit card they periodically send you coupons in the mail where you can get extra percent off discounts. My discount was for an extra 15% off but when I went to check out the cashier let me pick a scratch off coupon to try for an even bigger percentage. Of course I picked one for 15% but at least he offered. Thought that was nice. 

Check out the gold star clearance racks and shelves throughout the store. There are some great deals to be had and then when you add in the extra discounts get some screaming deals. 

So, I got a bunch of shopping done and a lot of people crossed off my list. I ended up buying a $20 gift card for someone and still walked out with three big bags of stuff for $51.00.

Face scrunched, I moseyed around the home section (passed by clothing- I am frugal and I like a good deal, but I am APPALLED that Vera Wang, Rock & Republic, and --what?! tell me this isn't true?!?-- Derek Lam have decided this route?)....Aside from being a Nordy girl, I'm also a Pottery Barn/West Elm/Crate & Barrel- girl too.

Nothing in bath ($50 Simply Vera bath math-$40 for her name. Its not that great), nothing in Home Decor, and I have WAY too many kitchen goodies.

I settled on three home diffusers- smells amazing :) - and my waffle/pancake mix I normally get at Williams Sonoma for double the price. Score- 28 cents under my limit and am I a true shopper or what? ;p Anyway, the real reason I gave this 4 stars and not 3 is the customer service and checkout experience. You're greeted right away upon entering the store, people continually check back (not in an annoying way) and the cashier was so nice and cordial. As a retail professional for over a decade, THIS makes or breaks where I choose to shop.

Easy and plentiful parking. 

Fantastic home goods selection (for the love of God keep me out of the cookware section, haha)! 

Occasionally will find some great threads here, too.

Love that they carry Lauren Conrad's line here (always some great apparel, plus cute jewelry), Apt 9 and Rock and Republic. 

So thankful that the Apt 9 / R&R denim, career pants fit me well. Many power athletes will lament the ""smaller in the waist, giant in the quads + butt = pant shopping is HELL!"" dilemma and it's rare I've had to take either brand to a tailor. 

Recently got out of here with three tops and a new pair of jeans for under $35! 

Active wear selection and pricing is decent if you're a Nike fan.

Spend $50, get Kohl's cash. Haven't and won't open a Kohls credit card, but it seems like there's plenty of benefits if you shop here a lot.

Luckily, they had the shorts, but not in the color she wanted, but she settled on another color.  The fitting room person was nice and didn't ask for a name and amount of clothes to write on the outside of the door like the other stores.  I can understand amount of clothes, but I think writing your name on the door is a bit strange.

The checkout service was much less than desirable.  There were two checkout girls, helping one customer each with only a few articles of clothing.  It took us 20 minutes to get the people in front of us so we could be rung up.  The checkout girls kept going back and forth between each other and the customers on what the sale criteria stated and how to actually ring it up.  It took one girl 10 minutes to ring up 2 sets of socks.  

However, I don't blame the people.  I think the problem stems from the way their systems work.  For example, the promotion will be ""Buy one, get the second half off.""  But it's rung up as 25% off both items instead of one item full price and the second 50% off.

They are so cheap looking, finally I had to ask an employee because I was curious, if they has switched manufacturers, I mean I know clothes are made all over asia and corporations will go wherever it's cheap, but seriously this place looks more like forever 21 or one of those cheap discount stores now. I used to purchase the plain white v-necks to where under my scrubs at work, and the last ones I bought fell apart after a couple washes. The line of clothes that has been put out recently, they are hideous, they don't even look good on the mannequins, so imagine what they look like on a real person!

Love it because they also have  NFL licensed 49er apparel for the whole family! The 49er tees for women are cute and prices are reasonable too.  They also have collegiate wear. I was happy they had a Hello Kitty USC Trojan tee!  

Staff on floor are friendly and willing to help, that goes for the attendant too in the changing room who will go out and search get the right size I need. Checking out has always gone smoothly. They have one line formed and cashiers help the next person in line thing.

If you go there expecting high quality designer clothing at earth shatteringly low prices then my star rating would make no sense.  But this place is great for what it's meant to be - okay clothing at a good price.  

Parking is easy here and the store is always organized and clean.  Although I'm not a large person I am curvy and, despite all the different cuts and fits of jeans, I just can't find jeans that fit here.  But I love this place for gym clothing and pj's - anything that's supposed to be comfortable but not necessarily worn fashionably.  

Their accessory collection seems to have grown over the past couple of years and the prices are very reasonable.  I bought a pair of hoop earrings here (for like 4 bucks!) and the clips wouldn't stay closed.  I kept losing one of the earrings but in places it would pop up again - the car, in the couch cushions, a friend's house, etc.  Eventually I just lost it and it never turned up again but it was only a 4 dollar loss lol.  I still have the other earring if I find it again in the future.  

I think my favorite things are the coats - very inexpensive for something that keeps me warm and isn't needed all that much in Las Vegas.  The prices are good so I can switch up my outerwear frequently.  

My husband says that the men's section has gotten smaller over the years.  Only like two aisles of men's stuff and most of the store is women and kids lol.  I guess I haven't noticed that because I don't pay much attention to the men's clothing.  

They also have cute things for pets like toys and collars.  I love going into a place that has stuff for my pupster too because he's like a spoiled child :)

After seeing some of their ads on TV, and that their jeans were starting at $15...I decided to make a trip down to the store closest to my home.

I had my daughter with me (in her stroller) and as soon as we walked in, I could feel how hot it was in the building. I headed to the right of the store, where most of the ladies' items seemed to be.

Then, it was looking for the right size, color, cut and length. I pulled the ""sweetheart"" jean, because it is for ""curvier"" body shapes. I grabbed two different sizes, and two different lengths....the ""regular"" length, and the ""long"" length.

The fitting room situation is a tad crowded. 

They have two clearance racks, and I guess the line for a room is to start there. The older woman who was working the rooms, saw me, and immediately checked the two larger handicapped spaces so that my daughter and I could fit with her stroller.

I didn't even have to ask! To me, this was extremely thoughtful...She even held the door open for me so that I could get in. I counted out my items to her, and she told me not to worry, that I could take in as many items as I like.

She then politely shut the door behind me.

Trying on the jeans, I was impressed with the way that they fit...I have jeans that are $200 a pair that fit me just as well...I usually only wear boot cuts, because I have never been able to find a pair of skinny jeans that fits me appropriately.

I am very bottom heavy....(thanks mom and dad...) However, with Old Navy's ""sweetheart"" cut/fit, the skinny jeans fit me, and looked more flattering than the boot cuts. I also liked that they had a decent size ""rise"" to them...not too low cut and not grandma up to my ribcage high... Just enough support.  I definitely needed the longer size though. 

Then started my journey of finding the ""long"" size. I was impressed with how well the jean wall was maintained...especially with a sale like this going on. I was only digging because a lot of the larger sizes (size 8 and up) were just thrown on the bottom shelves, disorganized and not in the proper stack....I did find the ""long"" size that I needed, it was a darker denim wash than what I wanted...but I was happy to find them.

Check out....is.....ridiculous. 

They have items that surround you while you are waiting in line....Food, toys, makeup, socks... you name it, it is there. I know that I am only feeling a tad negative about the check out process, because there are some parents who can not handle their children. Running up and down the line, (which is a tight squeeze)... throwing items on the floor, etc. The heat didn't help my attitude, by this time, I had a sweat mustache, and my hair was sticking to my back..

My cashier was friendly... and gladly accepted my email coupon. (sign up for old navy emails and on your first purchase, you get 20% off)...and I was even happier to see that it worked on the jeans, even though they were on sale.

All in all.... I have a great pair of jeans, at a decent price!","review","3m5rsk7xoLddGrLK3Qi5rg",0,0,1,"Old Navy","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Children's Clothing","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

The lyrics recited over and over Ni**a mother****r again and again and again. I told the pimply face girl behind the counter that it was really offensive, and she just looked at me and looked back down at her paperwork. Her job is to provide ""good: customer service, not disregard the blatant obvious. So i will still shop there, and I will also notify corporate. Im sure if she would have changed it, then i could have kept shopping, but everyone  I was with even said they wanted to leave the music was so bad, and we all work at the monster-size nightclubs on the strip, so it takes some really offensive song to actually bother us. when there are people shopping and kids outside playin gwith their parents, no store should have a song playing that says ni*ga this ni*ga motherf***er. hire some new people american apparel!!!","review","PpNOxcjb0nqNBI81785ALQ",1,1,1,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

I came here for a ""dress up"" event and actually ended up finding exactly what I was looking for: socks with ruffles. Yes, just like in the days of your infancy and toddlering days. I needed these, I found them, I left.

This wasn't foot odor, no there was dog feces still on the bottom of these shoes in the box. How did the customer service people not catch this during the return? I did eventually find a pair I wanted. I get in line for the single cashier that was working. Having been to Kohls recently I knew that they offer a discount on your purchase if you apply for credit. Well everyone decided to apply for the discount that day, and as you know filing out a credit application takes quite a while. This is really not a great system as it holds up the line anytime someone agrees to apply. So eventually after a long, long wait the manager brought in another cashier to speed things along. I had a coupon in Passbook on my iPhone for 25% off. I show the cashier the coupon and she looked very confused. She pondered it for a moment and decided that it must be a 3rd party coupon, and that they don't accept 3rd party coupons. I ask her to please try to scan it anyway as it came from Kohls.com but she decided that this new ""smartphone"" thing was too scary and to not even try. After asking a second time I gave up and paid the full price. All she had to do was just try to scan it or key in the number and I would have been happy, but no, she has to rudely tell me no.

The cashier- a young man was working quickly but the line continued to grow.  He called for a cashier back-up twice.  A woman- Monica came up about 4 minutes later and took the next person in line.  The woman in front of me had 1 shirt she was buying with no tag.  Monica walked around and around in the men's department looking for a similar shirt.  After about 5 minutes, she returned with a compleletly different shirt and said she was using it because it was all she could find.  The price is $4.20, is that ok?  The woman said yes.  Monica then said, I'll give you 20% off since you had to wait for so long and thanked her for her patience.  I thought this is great, I've been waiting just as long so I'll get 20% as well.  I was next and Monica rang my stuff up but no discount, and no apology for the wait.  I asked about a coupon and she informed me there were no coupons.  I said, what about the 20% you just gave that woman.  She said, that was for using her Kohl's charge.  I was not happy.  I looked on my phone because I had received an email earlier with a coupon.  The store by me, has scratchers and coupons at the register if you forget yours.  Monica offered no help and was quite rude.  I paid for my items and as I was leaving found the coupon.  I turned around and asked her to take it off and she informed me I would have to go to the Customer Service desk.  I went to the back of the store, where I waited in line for about 5 minutes.  I got to the register and the woman wouldn't take off for the coupon either.  She then called the Manager who never helped me or even looked at me.  He talked directly to the Associate, who relayed the information to me as if I wasn't standing there.  They all informed me all coupons were for card holders only.  Why wasn't I offered to open a charge?  My husband has a Kohl's card, but he wasn't with me.  If I had opened an account, I could have received 30% off I found out as I was leaving.

Dear GAP, let me tell you of the worst experience we had at your store and why we will never come back! Our experience is one of DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My husband was attracted by 40% off promo and spend half an hour picking out jeans and shirts. As he got to the register, he got a snobby remark he does not qualify because he does not have a gap card. Now the sales person should of given him 30% off, but instead they asked him to pay full RETAIL. As you would expect, my husband was unhappy and left your store in South Park Mall, Charlotte. He walked away from $200 purchase because he felt DECEIVED AND DISCRIMINATED. Note: we DO NOT open credit cards with retailers! That is bad way to manage financials. I was furious. My husband does not shop often and now that he finally did, he had such a bad treatment. So I contacted your customer service and they did nothing! They offered $20 credit and no sale. So RETAIL once again with $20 totaling to just 10%. The customer service promised the items are on sale once again at 40% and without card requirements. So, GETS BETTER NOW!!!! My husband goes back, stands in line, observes a lady being offered 40% off and then additional 15% off. His turn comes up - NO SALE! And once again - not a card holder, so NO SALE. They did not even take coupons that are active online. And, the sales person was SNOBBY beyond believe. She did not care to spend another minute with my husband to accommodate or find a solution. Sure thing - he left the purchase in the store and swore that he WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO GAP OR EVEN LOOK AT GAP. It is outrageous, selective and what is even worse, your quality is really not good anyways. A good ending to the story - my husband went to GUESS, got great service, 50% off sale, bought his jeans and shirt and is happy now. He will always shop there from now on. Bad ending for you - with this experience, I will no longer shop at the Banana Republic or any of your other stores. There is enough competition for customers to say no to such FORCED SALES PITCH FOR CREDIT CARDS AND DISCRIMINATION.","review","8z3nENP69rt8NZHh6y6Uig",0,0,0,"Gap","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Children's Clothing","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

I never imagined the stores would look like a cross between a broken-down bodega, a Plato's Closet, and a Salvation Army. I was actually waiting for the smell of mothballs and ""the indignant"" to overwhelm my senses. 

I picked-up the usual goodies (like knee-high sporty-socks and ironic scrunchies), but as I was swiping my card, I had the feeling of being INSANELY ripped off. This was a $60.00 bill for something I could probably get for $10.00 at a flea-market (there is always some crazy tube-sock dude at those places). Sometimes, the environment can really affected one's perception of the product. (I think we have all bought an obscenely priced pair of sunglasses because a really ""nice"" sales associate knew just how to sweet-talk us ... umm, that will never happen here. So, no worries about that. I hardly heard the ""cashier's"" voice ... SHE LITERALLY just said the total. End of conversation. Where is the manager here?). 

The place was less-than-clean (seriously, it's called a Swiffer, put down the iPhone and use it), poorly organized, less-than-inspiring (bare walls and metal hooks) and staffed by people who clearly don't want to work there. (Put down the phone, try a greeting, attempt a smile, ask your customers if they need help, clean a little, thank a customer when he/she makes a purchase, and grow the &$%# up!)

What a waste of space (we were the only people in there ... maybe because there are REALLY nice stores on The Strip with SUPER friendly employees). Seeing this made me lose complete respect for this brand. (And, employees, the place isn't hipster chic ... it's dirty and ugly. I know it may be difficult for you to tell the difference, so just ask yourself, if your stupid iPhone fell on the floor, would you put it back up to your face, or would you drop it in a vat of Purell?

I would imagine something amazing given the location, but besides that it's your typical AA store.

One day a couple of years ago I was desparate for a good stylist. 
I had just quit the one I was going to for 11 years. 
I called JC Penney Hair Salon asked for an appointment that day, they got me right in. 
That is how I met Shala. I have been going to Shala ever since. She is amazing. She listens to me, she styles my hair so beautifully. She is kind and gracious. 
I will continue to go to Shalas she is the best in Vegas that I have found. She is flexible and works aroung my schedule. 
She also can do waxing on eyebrows if needed.

I used to shop at Penney's for nightshirts, the huge selection of undergarments, and household items in southwest motifs.  The undergarment selection isn't as comprehensive as it used to be and nightshirts don't exist anymore.  They did have a table lamp that came in three different southwest patterns, and it was gorgeous, but I don't need one - I bought one online a couple of years ago from what is likely the same manufacturer.  Curiously, there was not a price to be seen for these lamps, neither on the boxes, the item, or on a display ticket.  And try to find a floor salesperson!

I was not blown away by the clothing selection, either, and the prices are higher for comparable stuff at Kohl's.

This review is for the Salon located at J.C.Penney.  From appointment to final cut, my experience was HORRIBLE.  I would have preferred hand my bulldog a pair of scissors and let her go to town on my head.

First off, the girl that scheduled my appointment and my sister's appointment scheduled us for an hour and a half apart.  I didn't agree to that, but whatever, a woman was there on her day off and they asked her to clock in.  Unfortunately, she wouldn't stop remarking about how she generously clocked in.

We each brought photos in for how our hair should be cut.  Mine's not bad, but my sister hates her hair, the woman spent more time diagnosing her dry scalp than actually paying attention to my sister's reference material.

I walked out of there with such an intense headache from the spots where my gal had burned my scalp with the blow dryer.  I was never trained as a cosmetologist or an aesthetician, but isn't it common knowledge that you don't hold a blow dryer in the same spot for an extended amount of time?!  After I told her about it, she apologized but then remarked that it was easier to just get the root dried first.

Does somebody have the number for Tabatha?  I'm done, apparently J.C.Penney salons are now the skill equivelent to Super Cuts with more money tacked on at the end.  Yeah, I'm angry that I could have paid $14.00 and gotten a crappy cut somewhere else.","review","M7gu56kwPFjci6OqNly8Kg",0,0,0,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

I had not been in a JCP in like 15 years; When I'd think of the store I would think of polyster and rayon and just outdated clothes. 

Flash forward to the presnt and I had seen a commercial for the Duro Olowu collection and I thought it looked really cool. I headed out to the store the same day the collection came out, since Target's collections usually go fast. I was surprised by the clean lines of the store and impressed at how they have everything distributed. The store dedicates a spcial section to each designer, i.e. Liz Claiborne, Mango, Duro Olowu, Levi's etc. It kinda made you fell like you were at a departement store.

Anyway, they ddidn't have the netire collection in the store but I ended buying a couple of shirt and a cute multi-colored cardigan from the JCP brand. I thought the quality was quite good and the prices were very reasonable. When I was at the cash register the girl asked me a bunch of questions about my experience at the store and also suggested some new collections that are coming up later this spring.

This one has plenty of parking, pricing now that corporate has changed strategy yet again is back to being competitive with Kohl's, and the cashiers here do a good job of getting you out and on your way. 

But all of the good stuff about JCP comes to a screeching halt if you decide to special order anything and ship it to this location. You have 10 days to pick up a special order and in that 10 days you can expect to be called repeatedly. If you tell one staff member you'll be in to pick it up you can expect a call 20 minutes later from someone else asking when are you coming in? The lack of communication among the staff, the quoting of policy like it's holy scripture and the general negative attitude have made me swear that I will never, EVER have a special order shipped to this store again.

I only saw her once every other month, sometimes a bit longer. Each time I noticed she was making some noticeable ""lifestyle"" changes. Nothing major...when I first met her she was married with a child. She divorced, started dressing younger and she would tell me about all the partying she was doing. Typical divorcee stuff, no biggie. 
On what would be my last appointment, I noticed she was really different...she was completely strung out and totally out of it. Resting herself on my head at various times throughout my appointment. Dropping her tools. Asking me if the pictures in the salon were crooked. Another customer was telling a story about how a coworker had given her a pill for her headache and how she ended up in the emergency room later that night...turns out the coworker had given her an OxyContin. Upon hearing this story, my stylist went to that customer and asked her if she had anymore. It was awkward and scary. I silently said a prayer for her not to ruin my hair. Or to cut me. And I never went back. 
I was in limbo for a long time...one day while shopping at this JC Penny, I thought I really need a haircut, so, in I went. It was a good move! My stylist and I hit it off and I was super happy with the results. After a year or two, my stylist moved to a different state. But she recommended another stylist at the salon. Shahla. Let me tell you about Shahla. She's amazing. People compliment my hair every single day. She's like the hair whisperer. She knows what will look best and exactly how to make it happen. Listen to her! She knows what she is doing! Her coloring technique is top notch. Her cuts are perfection. I couldn't imagine not going to her. My hair is the best it's ever looked. And she tells you the truth...if I bring a photo in of what I want my hair to look like, she'll tell me how much work it will take to maintain it, like how often I'll have to come in for touch ups or how hard it might be to style it at home. And she'll also tell you if your hair just won't do that. There's nothing worse than a stylist who tries to give you a style that does not work with your hair type.

bestie found awesome pants suitable for both work and play but they didn't have the color in his size. the friendly (and super attractive) nate immediately asked if he could call another store for us. bestie and i agreed the pants would be a wise investment, so nate began calling stores nearby and, after several minutes, found them and placed them on hold.

though i didn't look at the women's collection (like i said, i'm not a gap-goer), i did roam around the men's collection while bestie was in the fitting room and was amazed at how mostly everything was in place and cleaned up. loads of natural light also make everything even more aesthetically appealing. the only thing that would've been better was a sale. oh wait! bought three pairs of boxers for a lucky gent for only $15.95. no clothing tax in pgh = happy manda-panda.","review","m2rJWMkMl70kNUFwxZROyg",1,1,1,"Gap","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Children's Clothing","Pittsburgh","PA","Clothing"

I generally like Gap for cheap basics.  I don't care for their sportswear nor their fancier dresses--I don't think most of it is high enough quality to be appropriate for corporate or even business causal workplaces.  But for t-shirts, button-downs, shorts, jeans, leggings, and other such items for playtime or to wear at my more causal workplace, it's perfect.  I pretty much bought a new summer wardrobe for under $100 by going in on a days where most items were 40% and by using a TON of saved up rewards cards that I get monthly as a cardholder.  Plus Tuesdays offer an extra 10% off for cardholders.  Let's just say that I saved more than I spent.

What stuck out to me was that the girl--I believe her name was Georgette--who rang me up went out of her way to make sure that I got the best deal possible with all of my promotions that I could use.  It took three times as long to ring up me, but she was very patient and friendly during the process.  I actually filled out the store survey when I got home because I was so pleased!

Bonus, you can now opt to save a tree and get emailed receipts.  This will also put you on the mailing list to let you know when the sales are so if you're thrifty like I am, you can save a ton.","review","N_cH3QA_eXXmnzz-nzEeKA",1,1,1,"Gap","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Children's Clothing","Pittsburgh","PA","Clothing"

Everything here is super cheap though so it 's no big deal.  They do a lot of copycatting which has landed them in court with several designers.

 It was the official grand opening in the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas July 24, 2010.

OMG, WOW, Overwhelming, enormous and massive are words that come to mind. Did I say gargantuan?

The new location is 2 levels and 124,000 sq feet and not crowded. Except for the crowds of customers shopping.

They did a tremendous job, the store looks impressive!

Starting with the visuals - the windows were dazzling and all the displays and mannequins thru out the store were brilliant. Lots of glitter and gold! If mannequins could talk they were shouting ""buy me"", ""be me"", ""stare at me""!

The layout of the store is easy to shop they have all their different labels divided into sections. Sort of like stores within a store. Be sure to check out the new Kids section. T

hey now carry Men's, maternity, faith 21[extended sizes] at this location. As well as the usual Heritage [vintage], love 21, twelve by twelve [couture line] and they have a shoe + accessories section.

Don't worry about waiting for a change room; they have one in every corner of the store. With lots of rooms in each one. All the change rooms have mirrors inside and hooks to hang up your 6 room limit. Lots of friendly staff hanging outside the change rooms trying to hang up the clothes you don't want to put back on the racks. I felt a little bad for them they literally had heaps on the floor to hang up and put back on the already overflowing  go back racks.

Tip #1. Best place to shop is the go back racks

Tip #2. If you couldn't find something you were looking for keep looking or go back the next day because it could materialize.

Tip # 3. Set aside a minimum of 3 hours- you will need this time to walk thru and peruse .

Tip #4. Why waste  valuable shopping time  Take it home and try it on. Please see store policy below.

Facts + Quotes ,As I was told by the staff

1.     Question. How large is this store? Answers. 1.20,000 sq feet- 2. 31,0000 3.  34,000  4. very large 5. bigger then Macy's

2.      Question. Why is the section called ""twelve by twelve""? Answer. 1. HUH? 2. I don't know 3.  not sure 4. it's our couture line

3.    Fact:    It is the largest forever 21 store in the world.

4.      Fact: The location  used to be Lord & Taylor department store

5.      Quote: It took over 1 week to merchandise including  many sleepless nights.

6.   Quote: ""You can buy everything the mannequin's wearing, except the wigs. We don't sell those""

7.  Fact: This store will create 650 full time and part time jobs.

8.  Fact: The store has 36 cash registers 136 change rooms  and in fact the store is 126,000 sq feet

Congratulations, wishing you much success forever 21. I will visit you often. I will still got to the Meadows Mall location and for a quick fix Boulevard Mall. Sometimes, not often I don't have 3 hours allotted for one store.

Store policy:  Exchange or store credit is allowed within 21 days of store purchase with original receipt and tags attached. Merchandise must be unwashed, unworn and undamaged for exchange or store credit. Sale merchandise and  jewelry are all FINAL sale and cannot be returned for exchange or store credit. Unless required by law, store credit and gift card are not redeemable for cash or transferable and cannot be replaced if lost or stolen. There are NO cash refunds or credit back to credit/debit cards. [ This is what it states on the receipt]. I wish the policy was 21 days for exchange or refund. It would be easier to shop for clients and take stuff home on approval instead of getting stuck with a gift card.

I have been to one of the larger locations in San Fransisco but this place tops it! It took forever just to walk around and I wasn't really going through all the racks. There is quite a selection so ladies, make sure you have your walking shoes, a shopping purse (ones that sling over you so you have access to TWO HANDS!), and a large FOREVER 21 shopping bag to place all your new purchases in! 

There is a dressing room in every corner so you'll easily find one and the staff is pretty friendly. I did bump into a couple that seemed unhappy such as a girl who asked me for the time (obviously, she was counting down the minutes till she was off of work!).

The selection of clothes is fantastic. You will definitely come out of the store with something. They do have a smaller section for kids and men. I didn't have a chance to really check it out but from the looks of it, they have some nice clothes in there.

I was going for a 80's look for our Yelp Elite event and when you're looking for specifics, this was kinda a bitch to navigate. 

There was a lot of dressing rooms, but some are packed more than others so keep in mind to keep an eye on empty ones. One room upstairs I waited quite a long line, but a downstairs one in the back had no line. 

I also found some items on the dressing room rack or just out of place on a random rack not in my size and I pulled them off to ask employees where would that item be.....I got really general areas like ""thats somewhere upstairs...I think"" , "" I think that dress is somewhere downstairs in the back"" so it was fruitless trying to go about it that way. I also had one girl ask me if I needed help with finding anything so I said ""I am looking for a 80's outfit for a party""....All I got was a ""Oh"" and she walked off and greeted another customer...WTF? Don't ask and not say anything when I reply. She could have honestly said that she doesn't know what would be considered 80's and that she can't help with that.  I would appreciate her honesty rather than just walking away and being rude. 

 I ended up going through the ENTIRE place with bags full of clothes to try and unfortunately none worked. Out of the entire place, I couldnt find the outfit I needed and felt SOL for my costume. It's very frustrating. I got a headband. That was it. 

I will come back when I don't need anything specific and am just browsing for myself. It might be a while....I was really irritated when I left.","review","glRXVWWD6x1EZKfjJawTOg",3,2,4,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

While they are cheap, the clothing isn't really my style and the quality is lacking. I prefer clothing that does not fall apart after a couple washes!

I recently went shopping at Fashion Show Mall with a friend. We were both in need of an outfit to wear for a special event we were going to be attending. I had found my dress at another store, but was still in need of shoes and accessories. I really wanted to find inexpensive things because the chance that I would be wearing them again was rather slim. My shopping partner also need specific things.. like a fairly inexpensive white dress worthy of wearing to a club. 

We enter the new Forever 21, which is 2 story and department store size. A friendly employee greeted us immediately and offered us a bag. We declined and asked where we could find white dresses. The employee waved her hand toward the back of the store and said we would find the club wear in the very back. Sadly we were unable to find any suitable dresses in white. Strike #1.

On to the next item on our shopping list - Gold shoes. The shoe department is where I started to get discouraged. For a two story, 120,000+ square foot store, the shoe selection was woefully small. Strike #2.

It was take to take a peek at the accessories and see if there was anything we could possibly use for our outfits. I was looking for a specific style of headband, as well as a gold belt.

I saw about a hundred associates ""working"" there... a.k.a. walking around aimlessly, taking the escalator up &down, talking to each other. I think only one person actually asked if i needed help in the whole 2 hours I was there. She was helpful and pointed me in the direction of the shoe section.

There is a lot of clothing being double- or even triple-shown. There's actually not that much selection, just a lot of the same stuff. 

I don't care much for Forever21 anyway, because the quality just doesn't meet my expectations... I could probably find some pieces in Chinatown with a lot more detail for about the same price and comparable quality.

However, the larger it is may not always be a good thing. It can get overwhelming so if you see an item that interest you....grab it and try it on nonetheless because it will be a pain in the ass to try to relocate that item later on.

I don't like it being such a large store. I'm on vacation to Vegas afterall. Sure I love shopping (what girl doesn't?) but if it requires me to spend at LEAST 3 hours in the store....nu uh!!! I rather enjoy and take it the full Vegas effect than go shopping at a store that may require me to take up half my afternoon.


Either way, i'm a fan of forever 21 so quick and simple four stars.

I liked how big and nice this store was, but it pissed me off that they would have them same merchandise replicated 2,3,4x in different spots in the store? So if you liked a shirt but you couldn't find your size it was like a treasure hunt roaming around the store trying to find where else they might have hidden your shirt.

Really, I don't ever come into XXI thinking I'm looking to buy things...I mostly look and end up with only accessories. To look for something specific is quite a hunt so I'd recommend to come and roll with it. .I was rather pissed my last time looking for 80's  clothes for a party and a very specific kind of 80's look (80's valley girl) .  Don't do it to yourself...come with general ideas like wanting a new dress. 

 I think the idea of a department sized store is a clusterbitch, and it will always be a touch of chaos, but I think I have to give a bump up for the staff. 

I walked in and the staff was genuine in greeting people, enthusiastically. I was curious in this 70's boho paisley tunic and couldn't reach it. A SA helped me and when all of them turned out to be smalls, he went around the store looking for the right size and was super helpful. Staff walking by made sure to say hello. If you look like you were searching, they came to check if they can help out. 

You REALLY need efficient staff to keep a place like this as painless as possible. It's vastly improved since my last visit where I was on my own, and the staff was definitely overwhelmed that Saturday. Last visit, there wasn't enough people to ask, some seemed confused, and the dressing rooms were messy/backed up. There's a lot more staff this visit and it's only a weekday. 

It'll always have downfalls because of size, but at least the staff tries their best to be helpful and I can appreciate that.","review","glRXVWWD6x1EZKfjJawTOg",2,1,2,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Even with its monstrosity, this F21 manages to remain relatively organized. The best part is that there is at least one worker who knows where EVERYTHING is. I wondered about a top that I saw (obviously in the wrong section) and the worker called another one, who was able to pinpoint exactly where it was off the top of his head. I didn't find it, but I was really impressed with the alacrity of response. 

My one irritation was that they seem to have too many workers going around asking if I'm finding everything okay.

People know what to expect when they step foot into one--racks of disheveled clothes that were barely organized to begin with and usually look like a tornado tore through them and virtually nonexistent customer service. 

But this F21 deserves a review.

1. It is THE HUGEST Forever 21 I have EVER SEEN. It's the size of a 2-story department store. Step inside, stare wide-eyed around, remember to breathe, and begin your shopping excursion. I recommend going through the rooms systematically or else you will be like my friend and I, on our way to the checkout line, and then realize there are whole rooms you have missed. 

2. For a f21, it's relatively organized. There are rooms for the Victorian era-ruffled look, business attire, kids' clothes, etc. Each rack is also relatively neat and doesn't have the perpetual post Black-Friday look that most F21s sport. 

3. The store is very well staffed and the staff actually offers their help!

Rude at the cash registers, rude in the dressing rooms, and very unresponsive workers when it comes to basic questions like ""where are the open fitting rooms?"" 

Most of the fitting rooms were closed, most of the registers were closed, but there were 90 people working. I know it is two stories and huge and full of many different departments, but efficiency is definitely something they can learn.

Walked by three managers, no greeting or ""let us know if we can help you!"" from them.

The employees were also very nice and willing to answer any questions, and also inquire if customers need help or not. 

I was a little disappointed in the fact that the shoes section was a little small for such a big store, but there was still a bit of variety to try and find what you want.

Which, FYI, can also make it a bit overwhelming. 

My gfs wanted to go shop here because they told me that it was the biggest F21 they've been to.  I walk in through the front and realize I can barely see the back wall of the store. Yep, the entire location is about the size of a department store.

The first floor is mainly clothing and accessories, and the second level also contains the childrens and mens section. 

What i was really impressed with about this store is not the size and selection, but how ORGANIZED it was. I feel that shopping at a F21 can be annoying and time consuming because you literally have to search each rack to find items because everything is scattered around the store with no sense or order.

However, here, that is definitely NOT the case.  Similar style items are all grouped together, and you can easily find various sizes of whatever you are looking for.  The neatness and cleanliness of the overall store was definitely a big big plus for me. I'm definitely impressed that they are able to organize a store of that size better than the smaller stores located back in LA. I think I was able to browse through the store in the same amount of time it would have taken me at a smaller, more disorganized store. That's pretty impressive!

There are several fitting rooms scattered throughout the store on each level, so you won't have to wait too long to actually get a room.","review","lqgdn2ER_R9fNKMLgaJ2Xw",2,1,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

I almost felt like I was inside of some crazy circus maze and all the employees were a bunch of mute fashionistas that just walked around flipping their hair.

I was never greeted a single time, never offered one of those shopping bags I saw them walking around with, and I was never said, ""excuse me"" to when the employees would brush by me. It also seemed like the employees walked around aimlessly as if they were as confused as I was. They really should have a map of this store, so you'd at least know where you were going. I spent about 30 minutes upstairs walking around in circles until I decided to go downstairs to look at the accessories. I gotta admit, the accessory sections are actually very nicely organized, so I was able to find 2 pairs of feather earrings right away and I spent less than $10 on both of them. The shoe section was just a little awkward because there were about 4 employees walking around as if they were suppose to help you (none of which said anything to anyone there) and only ONE small bench. Actually, there were two benches, but the second bench was occupied by a giant mannequin! Needless to say, I didn't buy any shoes.

I ended up walking out of Forever 21 with a skirt, 2 pairs of earrings, a pair of shorts, and a Massive Headache. 

I feel like they don't really care about customer service at all here since they know they'll make their sales anyway. None of the employees ever said anything to me either when I was walking around, at the shoe section, or at the dressing rooms. The store is also overwhelming with its size and loud music. The only thing I can't complain about are the prices and styles, which is probably going to have me coming back here.","review","-K3ZjROK0ml2P-Rk7ttHzA",0,2,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

With two stories, it even has an elevator and its own his/hers restrooms (women's on the first floor and men's on the second floor).  

Customer Service is Horrible: 
Absolutely no 'Hello' or 'Welcome' from ANY employee and I passed about 10 employees during my visit.  Unfortunately, terrible customer service is consistent with most Forever21 stores I've shopped at.  Since customer service is extremely important to me, this knocks off an entire star.  Moreover, of the three register areas that I saw, only one register area was open.  Seriously, why have all those registers and employees but have only 2 registers open IN THE SAME AREA!?  I had to search for an open register by going from one side of the first floor to the other side of the second story.  Of course the employees saw me searching but did not offer to help.  They continued to chit-chat with each other and I am not one to ask rude employees for help.

Restroom:
The restroom was rather unpleasant.  I'm not expecting anything extravagant but let's just say that some gas station restrooms are more well-kept. There was an OPEN trash can, obviously filled with gross trash, right next to the toilet.  The sink handle was also broken. 

Selection:
This location has more products than any Forever21 store I've ever been to.  I noticed a few items displayed in different areas of the store.

Store: 2/5 The store is huge like a department store and I hate department stores. There's so much clothes the selection is way too huge. You'll just end up walking in circles. I never thought I could say this.. too much can be a bad thing. 

Clothing: 2/5 You get what you pay for. Their clothing is cheaply made and the quality sticks. Shrunk cloths is a given, I always shop for a size bigger than myself in tops because my tops always end up shrinking SO ANNOYING. I'm a small but I always buy mediums. 

ONLINE: 5/5 BUT like I said I LOVE FOREVER 21...so if your looking for an organized selection check out their website. Its a lot better than their stores.","review","sLxyYIYCorS-pTtUU4VLuw",1,0,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

A colleague warned me not to buy anything in Vancouver beforehand, as it would undoubtedly be overpriced. She told me about the 2-storey Forever 21 in the Fashion Show Mall that would meet our needs perfectly. Although I typically don't like stores that mass-produce cheap, throwaway clothes (oh the wastefulness!) I thought this would be a perfect place to prepare for a night out.

When we arrived in the city, we dropped our things off at the hotel and made the trek up the Strip to Forever 21. As others have mentioned, the selection is outrageously big. Overwhelming, even. The group of ladies I was with easily found armfuls of dress possibilities, which we promptly brought over to the change rooms to try on. This is where the trouble began. Now, I'm a well-proportioned and curvy lady, and I normally don't have too many troubles finding flattering clothes. Although everything I tried on looked great on the rack, absolutely NOTHING looked good on my body. If I weren't so confident beforehand, I would have felt terrible about myself, as I'm sure many other ladies have before me. I think it's just a matter of the quality of design and materials being ultra-low, which of course is how they can charge $15 for a dress.

In short: yes, there are rooms and rooms full of clothes, but they're all cheap (and not in the good, ""wow, look at this steal of a deal!"" way). At the end of it all, all I purchased was a few pairs of cute socks with moustaches, foxes, and owls on them. I'm glad to say I had packed a beautiful back-up dress from Anthropologie, and I didn't see a single other person wearing it while I was out. As for the clothes from Forever 21, it seemed like everyone else in the clubs and casinos was wearing their dresses, and they all looked cheap doing it.

WHAT: clothes & fashion galore!

For this review, I am going to talk about the upsides and the downsides to this Forever21 location!

Positives- This location is huge, and it once used to be the Macy's department store! There are millions of product to choose from, so you are bound to walk out with at least one thing each and every time you decide to go inside.

Negatives- Like I have previously stated, this location is huge! & if you already have something in mind, it might take a while for you to find that one thing you came in looking for, haha. And! Their return policy is the worse! If you have not yet tried to return something, and do not know their policy. You have 30 days to return or exchange your item WITH YOUR RECEIPT, and for STORE CREDIT. You do not get cash back, so buy something that you really LOVE! =)

Another downside is their customer service is extremely poor! It is probably one of the top retail stores who try to give good customer service, but fail to do so... I was in there a couple of days ago, and there were these pants on a mannequin that I wanted to purchase.  I asked one of the workers, and she had told me it was the last pair. Then she followed with another sentence (rudely) saying they can't take it off the mannequin.  So, in my head I am thinking why leave it on the mannequin? Other retail stores would be happy to take the clothing off the mannequin and finally sell it!

In other words, have fun & hopefully you don't get into a situation like I did! Haha =)","review","hjnt6pPjRlCNkdAyzzYeug",9,9,9,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

With the store divided into sections according to styles from vintage, to pastel, summer wear, club wear, hippie, to denim and many more, It's not hard to stay in one or two areas most of the time - then you realize you've spent half the day inside and the sun has already set.

If there's but one thing to bear in mind with any forever21, quality should be the last thing you should go there for. You shop there because the prices are affordable not because they're going to last. With that said, expect copious amounts of different trendy designs sometimes stacked in the same hanger-to-hanger pile. It's necessary to shift through the contents for awhile before you could find something worth buying. 

Shoes shouldn't be an option, they'll give you blisters for the most part. Tights and basics are sold at affordable prices. They tend to rotate the styles around different sections of the store monthly so one day you might find the new spring collection by the shoes, the next week, it's pushed to the back of the store - not exactly convenient for regular shoppers.

There's a DJ experience on certain days and the place can feel so much like a club - minus the alcohol xD My mom and I drop by the place when we've got time to spare.

Upon walking into this shrine of insanity one might wonder, is that a store or a night club?? Now I usually come here after getting my eyebrows threaded by the wonderful Glenn at Sumita, but the real reason I come here is because they offer plus size! You heard me right fatties, PLUS SIZE! Now you can look like your skinny club going friends!

The store here is wide and huge (just like i like em!!) lol its 2 levels and never ending! Bottom floor you have normal sizes, shoes, accessories, under garments, and some photo booth thing. The top level has men, plus size, and girls clothing. Why they do not offer little boys clothing is kinda stupid, but whatevs, they arent on H&Ms level yet : )))) 

The quality of the clothing here is hit or miss, as is the price. Ive found some good steals for cheap, and Ive seen some SUPER CUTE items, alas Im cheap and wouldnt pay 32$ for a dress. What I dont like is that they dont offer bigger sizes in jeans, only up to a size 16 or 18. BOO!! They do offer really really cute items in my sizes though and I love the fact that they use good colors and the clothes dont fit hella stupid.

Entering the store made me feel like I needed sunglasses and earplugs.  However, they do offer some cute, cheap clothes and accessories.  I needed to get a few things, with the full knowledge that they'd be ""one and done"" as far as wears received, so I didn't want to break the bank.   Their sizing structure is a bit weird (I'm a Small/Medium everywhere else, but at Forever 21, I've become a Large??).  

There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the layout of the store, even though it is the size of a department store.  It would be nice if things were in sections, you know- like a normal store- so you don't have to wander around aimlessly looking for things. One thing that really irked me in particular was the lighting.  Several dresses looked orange under their bright, odd lights, but back in the dressing room, they were clearly red.  I didn't know which lights to trust!! Since I was buying a dress to match with a pair of shoes I owned, this put me in a bad position. (I went ahead and bought the dress- it is red).

They have a pretty strict return/exchange policy, probably to keep costs down.  No returns on accessories, shoes, or sale items, and 21 day exchange/store credit  only returns on everything else. Considering the cheap prices, I guess that's not too terrible.","review","ChgmBht69bnqSdDxpWMAqQ",0,2,2,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

They have sooo much clothes - it's the forever 21 heaven here. It's clean, spacious, and there are tons to choose from. Bright side : there's two floors! It's department store sized.

They have almost everything you see online, instead of only a limited selection. There's a maternity section and a kids' section here, as well. Their accessories place is kind of limited, but oh well. 

There are plenty of workers here who are pleasant, and ask if you're doing okay. Cashiers are, so far, the most harried and impatient/surly people everr.

The only thing I don't like about this place is their lack of fitting rooms. I think they have only 2 or 3 ever open, even though there are tons scattered throughout the store . This makes for longer lines, antsy people, and more of a hassle to get clothes back to racks. There are so many employees around, why not just open more fitting rooms to make it easier for them ( and us! ) ? 

But anyway, I really love this forever 21. I always go to the fitting room several times (with a full bag every time) and, well, usually leave with a full shopping bag, too.

(Well I did make more shopping trips but you catch my drift). Both times I was pleasantly surprised. Since I have no Forever21 close to home (in the Netherlands) coming to Las Vegas and seeing this beauty of a fashion store simply blew me away. It was HUGE. I am sure that while I was in this store it took me a long while to comb out a couple of sections. I spend a lot of time in this store looking for outfits to wear and take back to the Netherlands with me. The quality of the products are good, all of the stuff I have bought have not broken down or have fallen apart. Which is the total opposite of what most of my clothes from H&M do. The service was okay, not good or superb. Just good. But I cannot imagine being so busy in a store as big as this one, and all the girls and guys that worked there looked amazingly busy. Looking for a dress, I was kindly helped by a guy there who, (I noticed and tried not to laugh, when I saw it) was wearing a furry tail. It was a bit strange to see but that's what I love about stores like these, you see the diversity from the people that work there. This guy really did his best to help me find a dress but we couldn't find it, eventually I found it myself but he was being very helpful. He didn't stray for a second when there was 'no hope' of finding the dress, like the experience I had with some staff members from different stores. The dressing rooms are always busy whenever I shopped there, I do feel that with the amount of dressing rooms they have they can open a lot more. 
After this I've only been in a different Forever21 and that one is in Antwerpen, Belgium. The one in Antwerpen cannot hold a candle to this one of course, but staff wise it couldn't hold a candle as well. I feel that the spirit in Las Vegas was more friendlier. 
A half star taken off the rating because of the limited dressing rooms available. Another half star because it's a really huge store and it overwhelms you, and I sometimes feel that there isn't really a red wire trough the whole store that comforts me in my shopping experience.","review","EkhjnZ6scWmQ3SlogNAOYA",1,0,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

For women who have fine-tuned their personal style (and branched away from the trends, might I add), Forever 21 will be a long scavenger hunt for you. It's an overwheming 2 storeys of the latest fashion trends with store layouts changing a little too often for our own good. I used to come here a lot the past 2 years until not too long ago, the loud pipe-in music started to not ring well with me anymore. 

More often than not, I would spend about 2-3 hours rummaging through the shelves & clothing stacks only to end up with nothing in my shopping bag but (probably) a new necklace - if I'm lucky. Once I got a cute gold-plated heart necklace that faded into an itchy (and rusty) bronze in about 3 weeks and in another instance, I got myself a pair of $17 jeans and the seams popped after about half a year. Sure, they're cheap but durability is not something you can count on with Forever 21. 

If you're a shopper who delights in quantity over quality and are looking into getting something cheap for a one-time event, stop by the store, but make sure to have an idea of what you want beforehand and ask the staff about it or else you'll lose a lot of time (& money, since there are a lot of attractive deals) before you know it. Don't be too quick to fall prey on the low price tags.","review","H1tN4ITtiMj3UH83OSviiw",1,1,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Yes, I know Im not buying a investment but it lasts enough for what I paid generally. I normally look at the stitching as some suppliers for them are cheaper than others and skip out on those not sewn in half way decently or really cheap feeling fabric. I don't know what other people are doing that things just rip on them at the time... but it doesn't happen to me. 

Then again, I happen to get caught on doors, windows, home decor, bushes, etc so maybe they're accident prone like me, just not as lucky as I am with clothes.

Truly, I would like to know how it is possible for me to snag necklaces as often as I do.

The minus and plus is this store is so big. It's easy to get lost and there's some outfits that are in several places so sometimes one area has all the size you need and you may not know it. This is far less of a problem if you are in the niche markets like the mens area, kids area, maternity, work out, basics or plus sized.

I'm giving this Forever 21 five stars because at all the Forever 21s I've been to the sales associates don't offer any customer service unless you are waiting for a dressing room or checking out. Two sales associates here offered me a bag to carry my stuff and just asked how I was doing in general.

I had the hardest time just trying to find a simple pair of flip flops because my other pair broke from overuse (walking up and down the strip a million times). For some reason, Forever 21 does not believe in having a coherent shoe section, but instead has a mini shoe section with random shoes scattered about the rest of the store hidden next to piles of camisoles.

For being the biggest Forever 21 in the world, they have an extremely small selection of men's clothes- I went there to hopefully exchange a pair of jeans I bought for my husband online, but had no luck finding the same pair in store. That was fine, but I waited in line to do an exchange for store credit and had to explain my situation to three different employees while they kept passing me off to one another- every time I said ""Store credit is fine, I just need to order another pair online""- then when the third associate finally rang my return through, at the end he told me I actually couldn't use the store credit online and that I would have had to send them back through the mail in order to get a return. I asked if I could have the pants back, then, and he said no, since he already rang it through. What? Finally another associate ran to get the manager and came back 5 minutes later saying that I actually COULD use the store credit online, they were mistaken. Overall it was just such a huge ordeal for what should have been a really simple return and I felt that they were too busy to pay attention to me when I explained in the first place that I needed to order another pair online. Which doesn't surprise me, since the music is so loud in the store that they probably couldn't have heard me anyway. 

As for the women's section, I feel like their prices have just steadily risen over the past few years- I used to go to F21 to get good deals on cute unique clothes but now I feel like everything looks like clubwear or cheap reprints of whatever trendy graphics are popular on tumblr this season (galaxy print, upside down crosses, etc). I feel that the quality of their clothing has decreased steadily while their prices have been on the rise, and if you go in there looking for a specific item you're in for a real scavenger hunt- it doesn't seem to really be organized in a way that makes sense, just room after room of random items. 

My overall impression was that it's a huge store and the employees feel overwhelmed and don't know what's going on. Nobody knew what they had in stock, what their return policy was, how to ring up my return, where to find someone who knew how to ring up my return, et cetera. I know it's a big store and with that many employees it's probably hard to keep everyone on the same page but their customer service really suffers. If you're looking to pay $20-25 for a thin strappy dress and are only making a purchase, this is the place for you, but if you want much more than that you'll be sorely disappointed.","review","x3Yhu-Gu1GeD6UqcvZhL2w",0,0,0,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

Instantly I thought he was your typical men's clothing store kind of guy until I started peppering him with questions.  Very quickly it became apparent Gabe knew a lot more about both casual and business suits.  I had specific ideas for my suits as they needed to breathe well.  After showing me several different types of suits Gabe picked out 5 suits and I loved eash instantly.  I then had to cut down to two suits for the final purchase.  He then talked about the positives and negatives of each suit.  There wasn't any BS spewing, just facts and numbers and personal opinion.

I prefer to buy a sports coat here.  They're more reasonably priced at around $119 and designed well.

This was perfect considerig we needed a shirt and pants.

When we finally found the outfit we liked we took the pant and shirt to the counter to find they were the same price. The gentleman at the counter said he had to talk to his manager to see which one to comp for the sale since they were the same price. Then a man who I assume was the manager walked up and told us the sale was buy one get one free only if you bought 2 pants or 2 shirts but that you could  not mix them. We pointed out that the two members of the staff we had talked to told us differently and that we had confirmed twice before deciding what to purchase. The manager just reiterated what he previously said with no sincerity or willingness to work on the price due to his employees misinformation. So we walked out without paying a penny and found the same outfit somewhere for cheaper, we will not be shopping here again.","review","PBLIO9nqZXzQGFSPT7mskQ",0,0,1,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

I needed to rent a tux for a black tie wedding in about two weeks. Came in and was quickly greeted by younger looking employees who were very friendly but slightly unpolished. When I think of suits, I think of older gentlemen, preferably with accents and finely coiffed beards. Nevertheless, the young lady working the computer pointed out various shapes, sizes and selections for my tux. She ascertained my budget and attempted to fit it. Despite my ignorance, she guided me through the process of accessorizing appropriately for the style I wanted. They took my measurements and told me to come back a couple days before the wedding.

To my satisfaction, the tux came in early! Everything fit perfectly and I walked out a happy and prepared man.

Policy states that you must return the tux (in one piece) the day following the event. The nice thing is, ANY Men's Wearhouse will accept back your partially soiled attire. I made sure not to lose pieces and avoided any penalties.

The whole rental cost me about $120 (including deposit). Pricey, maybe. But, consider all the free food and drink at the wedding! And after all, isn't looking awesome, priceless?

Tuxedo Renting Tips:
-If you choose suspenders, do it for function. No one will actually see them... unless you want them to.
-Don't forget to brush off those nice cufflinks you got as a grad present years ago. Otherwise, you're stuck with the free ones they include.
-Bow-ties are cool. The ones they give you are clip-on. Unless you're really good at tying one, opt for the clip-on.","review","ajYMtA6UN8nn9Dz7nFbLdg",2,2,2,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

I was an usher in a wedding today. When I arrived at church, i realized that I left my tie (which was by design the same as the other ushers and groomsmen) at home and did not have enough time to go home to get it...SO with the help of Yelp, I found a nearby Men's Wearhouse and called them to explain the problem while heading over. They said they had a silver tie but it might not match exactly. At this point I'm like ""a silver tie that doesn't exactly match is waaaaay the heck better than NO tie"".
When I got there an EXTREMELY nice saleslady informed me that they had the exact silver tie over at another store and she would be happy to:
1. Give me the almost-but-not-perfectly-matching silver tie so I could get back to the church to get to my usher duties and
2. Drive up to the store that had the exact matching tie and then drive over to the church to DELIVER IT...

Now, like most folks, I don't love asking people I don't know for favors and this was A LOT to ask for a tie, but I've heard brides can be particular about stuff pertaining to their weddings so I figured since she was willing then erroring on the side of safety would be a good way to go. 
so I left with the one tie to do my usherly duties and a bit later, the unbelievably kind sales lady showed up at church with the legit tie.  
Wow... this was so far above and beyond what I've come to expect from anyone in business, I'm still kind of thinking that that will probably never happen again...
OH yeah, I forgot... they did all of this for free. I didn't have to pay extra for the tie or her time to run get it. Nada.
Anyways, like I said... 6 stars plus a bag of chips.","review","hHiOtCo2NKFnOjZu_h9t-g",0,0,0,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

When I'm looking for a great business casual outfit or blazer to top off an outfit Kohl's is one of the first locations that comes to mind. This location especially has a GREAT selection of business wear for men and women. Ladies you all  are privy to browse the racks of Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad clothing lines ( two of my favorites), while the fellas peruse noted men's wear ensembles by Marc Anthony, Van Heusen and Chaps. 

The price for these great finds are usually pretty fair, compared to the price you'd pay at a local mall or other department store. 

The store layout is logical and flows well thru the space. Hanging directional signs are located above each section of the store to help guide customers to their desired destinations. Helpful Hint: Please note that if you need to make a return that customer service is located in the back of the store at this location, not at the front :)

Kohl's Department stores also offer a wide variety of appearal for children and juniors. Kohl's customers are also able to make selections in the jewelry, shoes and home goods departments.

The prices are higher than other Kohls' for the EXACT same product. I purchased a cardigan for $21 at the Charlotte Kohls while the day after I visited my hometown Kohls and found the exact cardigan for $15. That was a return. 

The selection in this Kohls is so poor. I asked an associate if she could help me find a pencil skirt in the middle of the summer and she said that they don't carry skirts. How can they not carry skirts?!?! 

Last week I stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed. I purchased this watch for $250 at their store and when I asked the lady to change my battery she told me that she is afraid to do it because she broke her watch changing the battery. Are you kidding me? You also have to pay for a battery change while other Kohls change it for free. 

I love Kohls but everytime I've been to this store I've gotten an attitude from most of the associates and never been able to find a good deal so I've stopped going.","review","ygotwYWqiQ9e9HjJdboMEw",0,0,1,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Swimwear,Home & Garden,Women's Clothing","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  
The Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.   I will never shop at Kohl's again, and I will ask my friends to do the same. Especially if for a gift.

Sooo I venture to JCpennay a few times per month. I really dont know why I go because they dont have anything I fall in love with, or anything that is only sold there. What Ive gone for lately is the childrens 25$ frame deal. The optical center is hidden next to the salon and the portrait studio, which is also hidden. Its also itty bitty and not much of a frame selection, but wth! So we went in and of course it was dead, a little lady helped us and luckily I called in and asked about the deal itself. The way its on tv you would think its a full eye glass set with a script, but all it was for the 25$ were the frames and lenses. No biggie, thats why I called! I took Santiago script and chose some frames. Now I sat and it was super easy, all she basically did was write down his script and the frame number. I then opted for a little professional looking pair. The total was 67$ and they came in 2 weeks later. I super loved them as did Santiago!

So back to the store, this store has ok deals, not as good as Grand Canyon dr, and def more messy... probs due to their sleepy workers. Plus a lot of the selection isnt the same. The shoes are def a hot mess, and I wish they had the same crap on sale as the other store!

The poses were not to my liking and I ended up directing most of the session as I had to have new pics for the house as well as pics for gifts over the holiday season for the grands.

Urban Outfitters was a store that I had long forgotten about and what a complete shame on me. For a while I boycotted this store because I was against the masses and the fact that Urban had ""sold out"" to major retail malls. Initially, the store had only a few locations in very hip or up and coming neighborhoods, such as Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. After browsing the online catalog, nostalgic memories took over and I rekindled my love for this store and we've since made up. Fans and patrons of this store are passionate about it. Shop here and you'll see why. 

I was first introduced to UB in Santa Monica and instantly became a fan. South Park has the only location here in Charlotte. It isn't the largest store, but it has enough variety. My advice is to shop online, as they have much a broader selection and they also have great deals. Sizing is ""true to size,"" so a lot of their clothing is slim. If you do plan to shop online, heed my advice - go into the store and try their sizes. 

Urban started out as a local mom and pop consignment store somewhere in Philly. They have kept the consignment feel and sell a wide range of products. Everything from gag gifts, to Moroccan influenced furniture, pillows to new trendy electronic gifts such as turntables you can use with Ipods. If you are hip and into the current fashion trends, Urban is the place to shop. They have great clothes for men and women. Some styles are vintage, some styles are new age or a variation of the two. They also have a lot of nice accessories/jewelry for women. Many trendy stores are modeled after Urban and their style. Forever 21's mens line, Heritage 1981 for example. Although a fairly new label, I've watched it grow and model itself and it's website similar to Urban Outfitters. 

Urban Outfitters is also the parent store of the much loved Anthropologie chain. If you haven't had a chance to see Urban Outfitters, I highly suggest it. Great, hip, trendy fashion at moderate prices. (shop online for the deals!!) You will very likely find something you like in the store. In short, I guess Urban is the perfect store to find unique, trendy, one of a kind clothing, but at a major retail chain (huh?!).

I love rummaging around Anthropologie!  While the clothing here is much too expensive for me to contemplate spending my hard-earned money on (besides that, I've yet to find anything that fits me well- please bring in petite sizing!), I do love looking around and gathering ideas on how to mix up the clothes and accessories I currently have to look more contemporary.  I especially like the sections dedicated to toiletries, linens, and dinnerware!  I've always adored French-milled soaps; in particular, lavishly-wrapped French-milled soaps.  So when I spied a few gorgeous and wonderfully-scented PORTUGUESE Castelbel soaps here ($8 and up each), I couldn't wait to hop onto a computer to check out the website for more info, such as how these products are made and which ingredients are used.  Had I not found them at more wallet-friendly prices at a Cost Plus Worldmarket (on sale for $4.99 each, plus a 10% coupon!), I might have been compelled to buy them here!  (Granted, the scents I found at Anthropologie were more exotic than the ones at Cost Plus, but I'm satisfied w/ such scents as Ginger Pear, Lemongrass & Sugarcane (so d'lish!), After Dinner Mint, and Amber & Vanilla- I bought 18 bars!)  I did buy some soaps (initialed soaps packaged in re-usable jewelry boxes) that were on sale.  As I mentioned, I also like some of the linens, but I can't fathom spending $18 on a face towel... I've spotted quite a few dishes I like here, as well, and  I just wish that most of them weren't made in China... I'll gladly pay for authentic French dinnerware!","review","0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ",6,3,8,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories,Lingerie","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

This is my all-time favorite store to window-shop in.  I can only dream of the day when I win the lottery and can afford to purchase all the beautiful clothing, accessories, and home decor.  To be fair, not everything is highly priced, and they have a large selection of sales items that are within my budget...but I swear, if I won the lottery, it would be my first stop (2nd stop, Z Gallery).  It's always beautifully decorated and has a lovely cozy/eclectic feel to it that I absolutely adore.  They also carry my favorite perfume there.  As a general rule, I never buy myself perfume, because I always get some for Christmas (this is on the xmas list this year!), but the sales associates always look the other way when I come in just to spray it on myself before going out for the night...tacky, I know...but it smells sooooooo delicious.

Part two - My apologies to the sales associates that delt with my crabby, frustrated, snotty attitude the night you couldn't find the item I had put on hold.  Apparently, a friend had come in to purchase the item as a gift to me.  After searching forever, one sales clerk 'in the know', finally came over and explained that the item had been purchased as a gift, and warned me to act surprised.  I sheepishly left, but still feel that an apology is due.  The sales clerks handled my attitude graciously and courteously, and I wanted to recognize that as a HUGE reason why I will continue to frequent this amazing store (sorry again!!). :)","review","zqnAdayPsak5dbLF2gEvNw",3,3,3,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories,Lingerie","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

Found a few beautiful blouses and a wonderful floral embroidered skirt from the sale racks here last week.  However, after wearing one of the blouses for a few hours (two, at the most) one day, I noticed terrible pilling (almost lint-y, as if someone emptied the dryer's lint guard and brushed it against the blouse, where the blouse then acquired a layer of lint on it).  I figured if this happened to one of the two blouses of the same fabric, then the other would eventually have the same fate, so I decided I'd return them all- even the adorable skirt, with its delicate embroidery that already made me paranoid of snagging a thread if I brushed against something, and I hadn't even tried to wear it!  The sales clerk behind the counter didn't even bat an eye and accepted all of the unused items PLUS the one I'd already worn!  What a great return policy-- I didn't expect it since I'd already worn the outfit (I was hoping!), so it really was a nice surprise.

While my luck wasn't so great the last time I bought clothing here, I'd still return and try my luck again, as the items I find are usually different than what I spot at other clothing stores.","review","0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ",6,2,8,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories,Lingerie","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

So here is my review. I bought those ""Super Skinny"" jeans when they came out around the end of September. 4 pairs. I know, I know... but when I find clothes that fit I usually buy 2 or 3. Or in this case 4. I loved the way they fit! I realized from the gitgo that I would have to buy a size larger to accommodate shrinkage because they were very super skinny. So I bought size 4. After every wash they were getting tighter and tighter and tighter until now I can't zip them up. Keep in mind I have been a perfect size 2 for over 20 years. BC-before children, I was a perfect 0. Yes, you heard me. So I thought, even though I have washed these jeans at least 3 times, let me take them back to my neighborhood Old Navy which is on Maryland Parkway. Of course I have balls going to return something a week before Christmas on a Saturday. I can only describe this store as organized pandemonium. No pushing, no shoving, no screaming, just rank and file with back ground Christmas music. A young girl met me at the door and I explained to her what the issue was. She immediately took me to the manager, Nicole who recognized me from my loyalty to this store. She said go pick out 2 other pairs and take them to any cashier I will let them know you have already spoken to me. I said that's it? That's it she said. Woo hoo! And off I went in search of skinny replacement jeans. Then I stand in line for 20 minutes, but every register was open and humming along. I finally get to my register and another manager, Dan, rings me up. He said that there has been an issue with the colored skinny jeans because of the dye. The lighter colors shrink more and they have had a lot of return/replacements. Then he said, and by the way these jeans are on sale, plus you get 30% off your entire purchase today. I'm like Merry Christmas to moi! New pants AND money back!! Needless to say it was a very good experience at my fave Old Navy. Good job to all the employees. I always say that employees reflect who their superiors are; when you are treated well it shows on the floor. Yep!

Beautiful clothes, accessories, home decor, bedding, and books with so much charm they feel more like great antique store finds than something a corporate buyer ordered for their hundreds of posts nationwide. 

Between the location at southpark and this one at northlake, this one takes the cake. Usually less crowded, a bit of a better/less picked over sale selection, and the associates are super helpful. (Not that SP isn't a great store, but being in that mall draws a lot more foot traffic...and little more chaos) 

Price wise, yes - you're looking at dresses between $90 - $300, most in the $120 - $180 range. Great quality and great brands, but not cheap - unless the item you love makes it through three or four rounds of sales and gets marked down to next to nothing. (Sometimes the stars do align!) Their selection of jeans and basics run about the same as higher end department stores, but sometimes what seems to be a basic printed top carries an astonishingly large price tag. (and sometimes a must-have dress just happens to be marked down to $50)

Great place to stop in for an outfit for special occasions (or everyday wear), gifts for all different types, a cute new book or journal, or a few candles and pillows for your own home.","review","GLJazgesK2b_mRYQaEc8rA",1,1,2,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

I know a lot of you girlie girls really like Forever 21.  And, yes, I am a dad and I should not be liking it.  However, I liked the idea, just not the execution.

1. Cool - to have a store focused on modern and basic trendy clothing at a very reasonable price is an awesome idea that F21 has got down to a science.

2.  Quality - Not sure of the quality as it seems that everything there is what you pay for.  In fact , for the costume jewelry we bought, the first several were broken. The 10.50 jeans seem cheaply made and the nondescript converse look-a-likes look like copies. Overall, I would say reasonable quality. You get what you pay for.

3.  Selection - Here, I am not sure how they do their sizing.  Shirts and Hanger items are squished into the racks so tight it is difficult to hunt for sizes.  

4.  Service - I am not sure they practice this effectively.  no one focused own really helping us and trust me, seeing me at the store you would think I needed some kind of help - stat!

5.  Service - At the store for 45 minutes tried on 8 items and did not get to one store clerk.

Forever 21 sells trendy clothes at very reasonable prices. As with most stuff, you are sacrificing quality to get the low prices. That said, you can find some terrific deals on basic items here.

For example... One of my favorite tank tops is from this store. It cost me less then $5. 
There are great deals on accessories as well... like earrings for under $3!

On my most recent shopping trip I was looking for some white denim shorts. I was able to find other colors, but organization isn't really this Forever 21's strong point. I asked one of the employees working to help me find white shorts and she went in back and a few minutes later she returned with exactly what I wanted. 

There are better Forever 21 stores out there. It seems like this one has as much stock as the larger stores, just less space to organize it all properly.

We made our purchases and out we went. After going to a few other stores in Galleria, my friend decided she didn't want the lingerie she purchased from there anymore because we found a better deal somewhere else. We figured since the receipt didn't state anything about  lingerie (only sale merchandise and jewelry were FINAL sale) and we were just there 15 minutes ago, we decided to go back. After waiting over 15 minutes in the long line to talk to the cashier, Nathaniel, called over (whom we assume was the manager) and were told that lingerie usually cannot be returned but that she would allow it this time (exchange for credit/clothing) because we were just in the store for the purchase. We were just thankful that they allowed this. So we quickly grabbed a few shirts to cover the cost and walked back to the register. But as we approached, Nathaniel, with a smirk on his face, told us we would have to go back into the long line. We waited again for over 15 minutes just for him to exchange our things.

I write this because I feel that customer service is incredibly important to a consumer and being in the marketing field in my own profession, I found this incredibly rude and unprofessional. Every store that knows and understands consumers, show gratitude and kindness. They allow loyal customers to return back without the wait. We will not be returning back to this store and would rather make our purchases somewhere else closer and more friendly, even if it costs more to go there.","review","jZaBoGXnaMNdDYksDr3Riw",0,0,0,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

My biggest frustration with this visit dealt with my trying to get in on the doorbuster deals. Something was going on with the people in front of me. They were taking FOREVER. Like over 10 minutes. But instead of pulling someone in to help with others that would be quick purchases, the cashier alone was focused on this couple. Meanwhile, the doorbuster deadline expired and I couldn't get the price.  Other stores have honored people if they are in line before the doorbuster time ends. Bergner's keeps those prices in their system a bit after the deadline. So...what did I do? Walked out with nothing. They lost a purchase cause they didn't want to give the lower price. See ya, Macy's.","review","2niwhUC9pAeHH_W29cl9Cg",0,0,2,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Champaign","IL","Clothing"

Wow there are some terrible reviews here, but when you look at the surrounding competition this is not that bad. Sure the store is a lot smaller than other macy's sure the selection is not as trendy as other locations, but there are still great sales to be found at this location. I am surprised that this location is two stores which even includes a small furniture selection which is very limited. The only upside is at least there is a macy considering there are not really any other big department stores except for bergner in this mall. The one downside is as other people indicated store staff is super super slow. It took close to 10 minutes to check out with only 1 person in line ahead of us. This is rather disappointing, but what can you do. 

Pros: some macy discount items are heavily discounted at the end of season

Cons: super slow staff, small inventory

Hidden deals:
1. Sign up for a macy's card to get the mailer with coupons.
2. Look in the sunday paper for wow pass
3. Use your macy card for additional savings sometimes up to 20% off","review","f1a9KwsObpE54Yp9A1fVoA",0,0,0,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Champaign","IL","Clothing"

Kohl's sells many things, including a plethora of (overpriced imho, but that's what you get when it has Rachael Ray's face on it) Food Network-themed kitchenware.  They have good sales, the store is generally kept clean, and the lines usually move quickly.

None of the above is the reason for my five-star review, however.  I rate Kohl's so highly because they carry the highly-coveted ""T"" sizes. No other store in Matthews does, so Kohl's saves me trips to JCPenney or Esquire as long as I don't need anything extremely specific.

A lot of times you fill find great prices.Other times, they'll try to sucker-punch you with one of those ""buy one-get one 1/2 off"" deals that are a total rip. ""Kohl's Cash"" deals are pretty good but when you make the return to shop again in the small window of time you get to use it, it seems like the prices are jacked up once again. Your best bet is to take advantage of their 15% coupon deals or ""early bird/night owl"" sales, but I still wonder if there is some price gouging going on? One would have to go there on a weekly basis and make some sort of research into the price fluctuations. I don't have the time. I just hope/pray I'm getting a good deal.

This particular Kohl's has the better layout over the Pineville location. Who needs 2 floors? There's always a mighty fine selection of Men's clothing but I find myself shopping in Young Men's as well. It's hard to draw that line on what is and isn't ""fashionable"" still for a man of my age (45). Some of the clothes in the ""regular"" Men's seem to be for codgers older than myself, so I try to hold on to what little youth I have left and shop ""younger"". They really need to separate the Big & Tall clothes elsewhere. I can see my larger friends having to hunt and peck for their clothing. Their clearance rack is pretty extensive and the employees do a great job of keeping the sizes separate. These racks are usually chock full of the other season's clothing, so you can get some great deals if you can wait a few months to wear 'em.

The lines at the registers are pretty bad on the weekends, but the employees are always friendly. One thing I wish they would NOT do is ask people to sign up for  future discounts when they're making their purchases, because that is a little too time consuming.

Christmas Decor - If you know me, you know I love to decorate with some class. I bought pretty red/off white stockings and loved that they are better than the ones I have seen.

Price - Awesome! I mean.. when you have Kohl's cash on top of sale price, it makes shopping a bit more fun, and addicting. I find myself having to come back before the coupon expires to spend on something else.

The only reason I went this time was because my mom sent me some clothes for Christmas, and, well, I didn't really care for them.  And keep the jokes about my mom dressing me to a minimum, please.  I was taking them back, thankyouverymuch.

There are three problems that I have with JCP - one is not really specific to this store, so I'll cover it first.

This is the only one anywhere near our house.  It's the only one in Charlotte (and it's actually in Pineville).  There was one in Eastland, but it closed some time back, after a brief experiment as an outlet.  It's just odd, but you can't really count that as a strike against this store - I just thought I'd mention it.

Second is the size of the place, and again, that's not really a fault here, as it is a department store.  What is a problem is the organization.  There isn't any.  Say you want to find something in the men's section - it's all over the place.  Finding anything is nearly impossible.

Lastly is the staff.  They are just about useless.  I took my return to a desk to see how much I had to work with (having only a gift receipt).  He told me $24.99.  So I found something for $24.99.  After returning to the same guy, he told me I owed nearly $9.  How is that possible?  He scanned the item's barcode, not the gift receipt - so I promptly made him figure it out - which should have involved changing the price of my item to the discounted price.  But it took him a while to figure that out.

I did get the discounted price, which is why I enjoyed the experience overall, and I probably shouldn't have - wouldn't have even expected it if he had scanned the right thing in the first place.  But it shouldn't have taken nearly that long.

The real reason I think it's worthwhile is that the prices (at least right now) are awfully good.  Lots of 50 and 60% discounts, so it's a good time to back up the truck.","review","-_1ctLaz3jhPYc12hKXsEQ",0,0,1,"JCPenney","Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture,Women's Clothing,Eyewear & Opticians","Pineville","NC","Clothing"

Those people are not 6 and a half feet tall.

See, here's the thing: when you're as tall as I am, your options are limited.  Trendy stores don't sell clothes for you.  You're stuck with specialty (read expensive) shops, the internet (if it wasn't for this, I'd be naked), and a couple regular retailers that have a smattering of tall sizes.

JCPenney falls into this last category.  Their smattering is actually a lot bigger than most others' (that sounds gross).  The pants in their big and tall section are usually just big (50 x 29, I mean), but they have a reliable selection of tall shirts in reasonable girths.  Some of them are even pretty attractive.

The reason this store doesn't get a higher rating is that it's pretty unorganized.  You kind of have to wander all over the place to get what you want.  Chances are, however, that it's there.

The store itself is newer and nicer, the staff are SUPER awesome and helped me; unlike the one at town center were they just sat there staring at me like I was gonna try and steal a cardi or a performance fleece. Beeshes! Anyway, the clearance area is messy as eff but its because of the scavengers (like myself) who go look for the sales! Although I picked clothes up off the floor I dropped. 

The boys (5t and up) is lame, they have like nothing. If I popped a little girl out itd be on, alas I didnt. But they shirts and polos I did get for my son were AWESOME! And hecka cheap ta boot! 

My checker was totally rad and joked with me and when I returned to return 2 items the checker was sweet and even gave me another discount!! Go there and buy!!

The store itself is spacious and well stocked. While I was shopping, there was a large group of teenagers walking around the same area. With my injured sister, we were still able to maneuver around them and not be pushed into the racks.

I highly recommend the men's polo shirts especially if you work in a business/casual environment. They have all kinds of colors.
Also, if you are a regular like me and know your ON sizes ordering online is a blast!

The Best of the West shopping center Old Navy has been around since I was in middle school. They recently moved to a slightly larger space but somehow this store always seems to be cluttered and unorganized. I used to think those adjectives were synonymous with Old Navy, but at other locations it does not seem so extreme. 

The staff at this location is not exceptionally helpful. Although I find it irritating when people constantly hound me about sales, it's nice to get the occasional ""hello"" or ""can I help you with anything?"" The only time a sales associate spoke to me was at checkout.

I don't like the new floor layouts that they use for most locations (and here), with the smaller entry way and the registers in the front middle. It's just very awkward and clunky, and I dislike it more and more.

Selection even for non-clearance material was dismal- ON used to be very well-made, whether simple basics or more on-trend pieces, but lately quality seems lacking. Here, the majority of their pants were boot-cut and those that weren't were faded wash, which is almost rare to see. Jean prices for this brand keep going up to a near-$35 average but quality is super low- tried on a few different styles, and fit was not flattering, sizes were inconsistent across styles, and denim was lower quality than they used to stock and had little to not stretch to them.

I primarily came for dresses, after getting several emails advertising their new lines for the spring/summer, only to find the bare minimum in stock in store and most store selection (for both dresses and clearance) were either in XS/S or XL, sizes 0 and 2 OR sizes 16, 18, and 20. Guess Vegas has a lot of mediums, or they just don't bother to order/stock the most popular sizes.

Frustrating shopping experience. Spent about $30 on a handful of shirts and some flip flops, was willing to spend a lot more to really stock my summer wardrobe but there was nothing worth getting. If this is what all of the Old Navy stores are like in this city, no wonder they're so few and far between.

Extra star for friendly staff. The ladies in charge of the fitting rooms were polite and quick, and the guy I got at checkout was friendly and asked about my day, keeping up chatter during the payment process.

There was a sale in the women's shoe department, so there was a busy vibe in particular. The store itself is clean, and there are many associates on the floor.

I requested for the card and said I would like to check back at another register as i was pretty sure that i had much more on my card. She said she would need to undo the transaction and tried again and the card showed the correct balance this time.

Good thing I felt like blowing a load that night and went with something equally as fresh from Hotel Collection. You can't beat the quality. I also bought bath towels I love.

Did a Sales Associate help me? HELL NO. I think her husband must have punched her in the head too many times because she was just off.

Me- ""Over where?""

Yeah, had to share. What's scary is giving someone like that your credit card information in hopes she doesn't mistakenly overcharge the shit on accident while she is drooling on the register.

Restrooms: Pet peeve. Why the hell is the restroom located by the Men's jeans? Let's be real. Men ""piss"" on occasion. Women use it more. Women really need the restroom for business or to beautify themselves or to change diapers or beat their children I imagine (which I would never ever do, but I have seen it done in there). Why then is it's location not more convenient for us ladies? Secondly the restroom was a disaster and just seemed old and broken. I'm sure Britney Spears would gladly walk barefoot and eat Cheetos up in there, but I didn't even feel safe breathing! As much as I spent on bedding and towels I shouldn't feel like I'm going Number 1 in a Third World country! Yes, I did wash my hands and no I did not sit on the seat. 

Get it together Macy's. You have great product when it's available, but you have got to work on your staffing, cleanliness and ads being misleading.

On more recent occasions, I have had two different employees ring up my transactions separately (one time in four transactions) so I save the most amount of money.
Giving me a ton of coupons, and discounting one of my items because it had a small (fixable) stain.

I find prices to be lower at JC Penneys optical than at Eye Masters and Lenscrafters.

Had to return to the optical dept. for a problem with my frames. Instead visited JCPenneys-Arrowhead where they had a huge selection of frames. 3 or 4 times as many as Christown.

Recently they changed all that, now they just have new ""low"" prices! I personally don't think they are ""Low!'  They were lower before with all the sales and then the coupons. I got rid of my J.C.Penny credit card because of the new ""High"" prices...That way I won't be more timpted to go there to buy things.

Recently we had our Christmas Pictures there. The lady who took them was Awesome!! She was real good and patient with the kids even though I was loosing my patients! She was super sweet and took a long time getting them in some great poses.

But After she handed me off to a ""New Christmas Employee,"" talk about Dumb!!! This girl knew nothing abpout pictures and how to order them! The first lady that was so sweet was now taking pictures of an infant and could over hear us, so she came over there a few times to help us. 

Needless to say, I ended up with the wrong size and wrong quality of pictures a week later. I was devistated! The Sweet lady was once again ""very sweet"" and told me they already fired that girl. GREAT MOVE JC PENNY!!!!

This sweet lady (sorry I forgot her name) ordered me evey thing I had origionally ordered and ordered me a 16X20 frame for my 16X20 at NO CHARGE!!!  Then I came back a week later and ordered $50.00 worth of more photo's. We absolutely Love the pictures...  We already scheduled the kids to have Valentine's Pictures there with the Angel wings, harp and halo. Can't wait to see those...

So the Only downfall about JC Penny is their prices went up!","review","2v3j2y5PLMs0rlAd-pxoEw",3,3,4,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Phoenix","AZ","Clothing"

I'm not sure what was worse...the arrogance of the optician or the ignorance.
1)  When I asked to put my regular prescription into a pair of glasses I'd found with plastic lenses, she said it couldn't be done.  I handed her the glasses on my face and said ""Walmart can do it."" She tapped the lens and said ""They seem like they're plastic.""  (Yes, I know they are because I bought them...duh. Did she think I was lying???)

2) I explained my prescription for my second pair of glasses, but she said ""I've been in the field for 15 years and I've never heard of a prescription like that."" (Yeah, probably because you haven't ever worked for any good doctors!)  Even after I explained the reason for it and how it worked, she was looking at me like I had four heads and said ""I would have to see the prescription to verify that.""  (Really? Because eyeglasses prescriptions are something people lie about?? And wouldn't you see the prescription anyway when you make the glasses?  Ugh.)

2) On top of it, when I told her that I usually have my second prescription put in a pair of reader frames, she said they couldn't do that. I told her that I've never heard of an optical shop that can't do it and in the five lenses I've put into my reading frames, not one optical shop has refused me...I told her that I'd just come from Target and they could do it. She called her supervisor to verify that they couldn't do it and the supervisor said ""No, of course we don't do that."" When she told her that Target will do it, the supervisor said, ""I guess they're really desperate.""  Wow...maybe they are just more competent at making glasses over at Target or at any of the other places I've gotten my reading frame lenses replaced.","review","raMSkwLdZ-kFea1fTY_-Ew",1,1,4,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Phoenix","AZ","Clothing"

Well, here's the bottom line. I used to get sales flyers and special deals in the mail every month, and they'd be incredible deals. When I stopped receiving them, it was apparent that they had changed their marketing strategy, and were trying to become more of a ""Macy's type"" store. But, the difference between Macy's and Penney was that the merchandise in JC Penney was crappy, almost on the level of Walmart, and they were now charging Macy's prices!

Gone were the deals. Gone was the variety of inventory. And the final straw... Went to get a coffee maker there and they only carry their Cooks brand of small appliances, and it crapped out on me after about 3 weeks. That did it for me.

I have no complaint with the staff, cleanliness of the store, etc. In fact, it was a great location and nice place to shop. It simply became a shadow of its former self as far as inventory and prices.

I read an article just this morning about how they are going to be going back to being more of a discount merchandising retail store, and this is a move in the right direction.

I'm the first to say that I've been a fan of JC Penny's for quite some time. I've gotten some pretty good clothes and bedding from them over the years, and I find that I can usually find what I need. When I was a kid I remember my grandma would come here a lot because she loved their towels and bedding, and as an adult I loved their clothes for work and such.

Today was no exception. I've noticed over the past year or so that they've changed some, and tried to lower their prices and done some different marketing.  It's still the same JC Penny's that I'm used to, but I didn't seem to find as much as I had hoped here today as I had wanted to.

Maybe it's just me, but I found some of the stuff a bit pricey, but most was reasonably priced.  I didn't score any pants like I had hoped, and that kind of bummed me out.  I did get two nice tops though for a grand total of $20.  I still love them, and this store has everything a Penny's should have, but I did take away a star just because I wasn't happy with the pant selection.

Overall I still love shopping here, and the staff was really friendly and helpful.

I am extremely disappointed with this store! Service was absolutely horrible.

I always remember who helps me so that I may do my part as a customer and give the employee credit for the sale while at the register. The cashier did not even ask who helped me otherwise I would have told them it was unfortunate that no one even acknowledged. Also, employees did not have a professional demeanor at the cash wrap and were chit-chatting while ringing up customers.

If you have a return like I did, be prepared for a walk and a short cruise up the escalator .
O.K, four stars just for the size and selection of the store ( I noticed things in the store that i had eyed on line and other Kohl's locations did not have in store.
Now about the return. I purchased a cute pair of Vera Wang boots that were $50.00 bucks and with only two wears, the poorly made boot heal twisted.
 Now this was a first for me. Will they take them back even though I wore them? I always thought if they are worn they will not except the return. But they did ! And the woman at the service counter was thankful that I told her  that they had been worn.

Who knew a Kohl's could be this big. I realized for the first time walking into this one just how crappy the one in Gastonia is. I don't think I gave the one in Gastonia a good review anyways... Long lines, not enough people on registers.. an meh selection.

Like John Belushi said in Blues Brothers, ""This place has everything!"" as they were driving inside of the mall in the Blues Mobile.

This reminds me of the JCPenny's or some of the Macy's in Miami. Two floors are required to house all the stuff. 

Speaking of stuff, the selection was spot on. You're not getting Brooks Brothers here, ok? But what you will find are stylish clothes at extremely reasonable prices. The selection is so decent that we were even able to hold an item from their inventory/stock from a different Kohl's (yeah the one in Gastonia) until we could get there to pay for it. The store is not a showcase of fine clothing store organization.. But who cares? 

I know this sounds redundent.. but everything is on sale. Of course it is. That's easy to do when prices begin at suggested retail (no store uses retail prices) and then drives the percentage off of that to end up where everyone else already is - sale or no sale. Take it from me - I was in retail for awhile. Just trust the fact that you are getting decent prices - overlooking the ""SALE"" glamour.

As it is conveniently located at 485 and S. Blvd, take the time to come here.","review","Gjj3zyvMSc3tY2bmFRQwRg",0,0,0,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Swimwear,Home & Garden,Women's Clothing","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

I am already a huge fan of Kohl's but this one far exceeds my expectations because its HUGE. I love it! 

There is a huge variety and an escalator that takes you upstairs to more goodies. The Men's Women's and Junior's department are outrageous, packed with very cool items and selections that anyone would enjoy, great items also for your home needs as well as luggage, jewelry and so much more. 

I enjoy the variety and the size. There were plenty of employees, and even the manager was out walking the floor asking if I needed any help. 

Great visit! Great selection! Great employees!

The shoes clearance could stand a little overhaul, but I'm sure that's about to happen since they're handling inventory now, so it should be a lot easier to find sizes now... I had to search all the aisles to make sure I wasn't missing my size, but I found some great things that way... Score!

"SrIqBoVRVVwkPmXyzxruOw","2013-05-07","nsb-3K1rGtLkcBW4GgYuMA",3,"I would give this location 4 stars for their selections and sales and the first floor. I recently popped in to do one of my least favorite things - shop for jeans. I was able to try on many different styles, fits, and sizes and was able to finally find a fit/style that worked for me! It is very rare for me to find jeans on my first stop. The first floor looks mostly organized and is easy to navigate. Upstairs, they have a decent sized section for bras. Their bra sizes don't stop at Ds, so if you're looking for larger sizes, check here.

The reason I knocked this location down to 3 stars is due to upstairs. When you come off of the elevator (if you take it instead of the escalator), you come out in the shoe department. The shoe department is chaos. There are some women's athletic shoes to your left with the other women's shoes. There are some sections of other women's athletic shoes to your right, but you'd miss them if you didn't decide to just take a look in the men's athletic shoe section. There is no rhyme or reason to how the boxes are stacked. If you see a display shoe you like, it's almost impossible to find where the boxes for that shoe is. Once you do zero in on a section you're interested in, be sure to check behind the front rows of boxes because some sizes may be hiding. Even if you find a box that suggests you've found what you're looking for, you might be surprised to find someone's old/used shoes in the box instead. As if that wasn't chaotic enough, you're dodging young children wrestling or running about and trash, like soda bottles, left or thrown into the aisles. Things are a little quieter in the bra section, but you can still hear families treating the store like it's a jungle gym. Kids are going to be kids and parents are going to be annoyed at their kids, that happens anywhere. I suspect the reason for all of the ruckus upstairs though, was that I did not notice a staff presence upstairs. I'm sure the rambunctious families quickly noticed the lack of supervision, too. One other reason for the star deduction is that it is a little difficult to get around in each department. Racks are really close together so you either have to go back out to the main walkway and loop back or just know you're going to be knocking things off of racks as you go.

While I might not go back for shoes (they had very little of what I was looking for in sizes larger than 9s) or bras (nearly all the bras I came across started at $32) I will go back and shop on their first floor. 

Tip: if you have a cart or stroller, utilize the elevator instead of hauling it up the escalator. The elevator can be located at the back of the store. Find the women's jeans section and it's right back there.","review","O4T_MAY13Hri1MZhJgT20w",0,0,0,"Kohl's Department Stores","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Swimwear,Home & Garden,Women's Clothing","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

The drawbacks of this store: everything else.

Periodically I hear from friends that they get a good deal from Kohl's or they find a gem. And of course they have designer value lines like Vera Wang's Simply Vera. So I think ""I must not be doing this right"" and I give it another try.  So every year or so I wander in hoping to find a gem of a deal- either on clothes, shoes, accessories or housewares. They have a decent selection of towels and dishes but the rest of the merchandise is overstocked (forcing you to pore through racks and racks of merchandise often without logic or order) and the quality is not good. I can try on 15 items of clothing and not find a single thing I liked. Surprisingly, I actually have much better luck at Marshall's and Target. The equivalent of their store brand for kitchen appliances has terrible reviews, so that's not really providing good value.  It kind of reminds me of a better lit Kmart.

Meaning that about 5% are so shockingly awesome that it's as if they contain some magnetic device drawing me and my wallet to the checkout counter, and the other 95% are--well, strange would be a polite word for it.  Fashionable clothing is like that:  eye-catching fabric thrown together in creative ways, lumps here, gaps there, and oh!  what's  that interesting little piece of flesh I'm exposing down there?

One thing I especially like is that they've got lots of styles that suit my figure, nice and drapey on the top, but fitted around the waist and hips.  (My bra size is 32Y, as in ""Y bother?"")   Garments tend to be delicate and expensive, best worn for work and special occasions, rather than home and play.  Since wardrobe basics are cheaper elsewhere, I think of Anthropologie as a place to go when I'm looking for splashes of color and style.

The sales staff has always been friendly and helpful.  They let you do your business, but there's someone there to help when you have a question or need something.  Their sale room is crammed with both clothing and shoppers.  The deals are excellent, though I can't say I've ever found anything in there.  Just shopping in this place is so enjoyable; when you get tired of looking at clothes, you can always check out enameled Victorian doorknobs or jewelry made from antique typewriter parts, or whatever else they've got lying around.

The whole thing started on Saturday when I purchased 3 dresses for my niece during the one day sale. I bought them at Colonnade. The sale was a one day sale on girls tank dresses for $7. The dresses were clearly marked $7 and there were a mix of solids and print. I bought 3 with prints.  The dresses I picked were all from the side of the display rack that had a $7 sign. They weren't just one or two mixed in there were full size runs. The other side of the rack had tunics for $8.50.  I was charged $10 each. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until this morning when I looked at the receipt. I live by Arrowhead and that's the location I went to for a price adjustment receipt and dresses in hand. I waited in line for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The cashier checked with whom I assumed to be an assistant manager or lead. I was told that the Arrowhead location didn't have this style (same style just a print instead of solid) on sale but they would call the location I went to for verification. I waited for nearly 10 minutes and in front of me the cashier told the same lead that the Colonnade location had put them on sale for $7 because they had such little inventory of the ones that were actually on sale. He then asked if he should just refund me the difference. She told him no and went to check with the store manager. After waiting another 5 minutes she came back and said if I wanted the price difference I would have to take it to the Colonnade store for a refund. I asked to speak with the manager. We waited 10 more minutes for her to come out. From the start she was defensive and rude. She told me that she called that store (because apparently she didn't believe the employee that had already called them in front of me) and told me that I was wrong they never had the dresses set up like that and if there was a mistake, it was that store's mistake and they would be the ones that needed to fix it not her. That's right. She said. Multiple times actually. I told her I am not driving 25 min to get a price refund and she said I can keep the dresses or return them. I asked for a refund and she told me to get back in line and walked off.
This behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is.
The price difference wasn't huge and I probably would have kept them. I was even planning on doing some more shopping. My mom even had several items in her hand and put them back.

Now most furniture is made in Viet Nam or China, with poor craftsmanship, but still with relatively high prices. Oh, I guess you can still find quality, if you want to spend $12,000.  We don't.

After striking out at the few remaining free-standing furniture stores, but skipping known crapola joints like Ashley's, we headed to Macy's Home.  If I hadn't noticed the store casually while driving past it one night, we never would have found it, since we were coming from the opposite direction this time, and the store is well-set back in its unusual Chinatown location.  Also, it was nighttime and the store was not lit up at all; it looked like it was closed.

To its credit, we were helped immediately by a very knowledgeable saleswoman, Rochelle, who spent a good amount of time with us.  She showed us everything available in the contemporary style we were looking for, but as I suspected, the prices - even ""on sale,"" (and I use the term loosely, since that stuff is always ""on sale,"") were too high for the shoddy workmanship of the products.  I guess the concept of Dove-Tailed drawers went out with Noah's Ark.

Natalia was very patient with us, and we felt she truly had our best interests at heart. She took the time to clearly explain the process and what to expect next.

The store itself is older, and I took off one star because it really needs a makeover/overhaul. 

We were very pleased, as always, with the Macy's store policies on shipping, cancelling orders, etc. We loved that the funds are not actually taken from our account until the furniture is actually available and being shipped. We understand the sofa should take about 8 weeks to arrive to us. Because of the quality of the furniture, the service from Natalia, and the store's ethical policies, we feel it is best to be patient and have the confidence our order is truly being taken care of and that Macy's will stand behind their promises. 

Natalia also pointed out that perhaps in the next 8 weeks the price might drop - she will check for this and adjust the price for us - so we will always lock in the lowest sale price. What a generous policy!

Natalia even walked outside with swatches and a sofa pillow, so that we could see the color in natural sunlight. She really went above and beyond.

If you're looking for a safe, quality furniture-buying experience, please try this Macy's home store. You can also call and ask for Natalia. She has ten years of furniture experience.

Also, we had viewed some of the sofas online in just a random Google images search, and that is what drew our attention to Macy's. We were actually impressed that the prices were not has high as we feared - we were a bit intimidated, so it was not a store we had considered. It is so nice to have confidence in the quality of what you are purchasing, rather than looking only at the dollar amount and receiving disposable furniture in return.

I have always loved the general look of the stores and the things sold in them, and this one is no exception - actually, to be honest this store is really nice, spacious, and well designed, so it was an even better place to browse than some of the other Anthropologie stores I've explored. It was definitely much easier to browse through the selections here because things weren't crammed into a smaller area, always a problem at the Anthropologie located in a small mall I live near.

However, the honest truth is that on closer inspection 99.9% of Anthropologie clothes are just not for me. The jewelery lineup here during my last visit did not impress me; there were just too many bug necklaces and rings for my taste (give me owls and foxes any day!). I took issue with the shirts, dresses and so forth as well: many were made from really itchy uncomfortable fabrics. But honestly, the ultimate deal breaker is just that all of the clothes and accessories are entirely too expensive! Seriously, I've seen items half off here that cost $150. I mean, I'm not a total cheapskate, but $150 for an accessory? Sorry to say but between the designs and the prices nothing appeals to me clothing or accessory wise, and that's always been the case. Sorry, Anthropologie.

There is, however, one reason I will continue to explore Anthropologie: the home items. I have found some of the cutest home decor items here: book ends shaped as horses, beautifully colored mugs, a Union Jack picture frame, very lovely pillows...just to name a few of the things I've found - and usually they're a little more reasonably priced and well worth the money.

I guess Anthropologie's doomed to be a mixed bag all around for me. But at least it's not a total lost cause, right?","review","DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA",0,0,0,"Anthropologie","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Pittsburgh","PA","Clothing"

The girls there were really nice, so I don't know what everyone is talking about. They were pleasant to everyone and were very non-judgmental towards the normal, lower middle-class patrons such as myself. One of the girls even said she liked my hat, which I'm pretty sure I bought at a Burlington Coat Factory or JC Penney or something.

And sure, the stuff is expensive. It's not one of those places where you go and buy up half the store in one visit. But what other store do you know of that has a clearance ROOM? I know plenty of places that have a clearance rack, but never a whole room! It was lovely! I don't know how I feel about the clothes. If I had more time I would try a bunch of stuff on to see how it looks on me, but I didn't have time for anything other than browsing today. 

What I did love was the dishes and books and candles and jewelry and scarves! So I think that means pretty much everything else in the store. It's definitely a girly place, but I am a girl, so that's alright. Every time I turned around I saw something that I had to have, a magnetic kitchen timer, a mug with my initial on it, a claw foot teacup, an intricate lace scarf, a honeysuckle candle... I could go on. 

For me, Anthropologie is just a ""fun"" store.

I've recently come to terms with the fact that sometimes buying cheap clothes is not a bad thing.  The quality is not superb here, and most items won't last more than 5 washings, but for a $25 dollar dress, I can deal with that.  Forever 21 stores have a huge selection of clothes and they try to organize them by ""theme"" or style. It can be very overwhelming, so you should plan on walking around for at least 30 minutes before you even hit the dressing room.  I don't find that their ""going out"" clothes are too hot, but they have great everyday wear, and even some items you can wear to the office. I was recently surprised to see that some of the stores have added a men's, maternity and plus size section.  I'm currently not in the market for these sections, but it's cool anyway.  Their clothes fit pretty true to size, and unlike H&M you don't have to be a pencil to look good in them.  One thing that I found very strange is they can NOT take anything off the manikins. If you that is the only item left in the size you need, you have to put it on hold until the window display changes (which I believe occurs on Wednesdays), this is challenging because you can't try it on, and you only have 24 hours to pick it up.  Even with their funky"" fear of naked manikin"" policy, they still get 5 stars for price, 4 stars for selection, and 3 stars for quality!","review","Zwtx7FLZcK5F2P0-Tz8mHg",0,0,1,"Forever 21","Women's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories,Shoe Stores","Scottsdale","AZ","Clothing"

The manager I spoke to wasn't there that day.

They have a variety of colors and styles to choose from and since I change up styles daily then you can see why I'm in here so much.  You can buy pieces for a vintage chic look, punk look, modern and classy look, and downright trashy (sometimes you actually need this :)
Anyone who has been in Forever 21 will tell you when you walk in (especially the one at Concord Mills) you're immediately drawn to section where the accessories are.  Just look down and follow the sparkly tile right to the sparkly section to pick up dozens of sparkly pieces!  The biggest plus is the price...$3.80 - $10.80.  I have bought several pieces from their and none of them have faded, chipped, or prematurely broken (and when I say prematurely I think we all have bought a piece of fashion jewelry, put it on and then for no reason than it's just poorly made the clasp breaks or the necklace snags a little and it breaks in half).
Then there's the clothes.  Again, whatever look you're going for they have it in all the latest colors for the season.  And for my girls who like me have booty...hips...shall I just curves (small to large curves it doesn't matter) they have a Forever 21+ where the sizes go up to a 20.

the bags/sunglasses/jewelry/gloves/shoes/scarves - all pretty good, usually love the styles, but again with the price to quality ratio i rarely buy. you know those super-cute finglerless gloves that have a flip top to become mittens? you know how they're like $5 at target? they're $16-$24 here. it's tempting, but really, $16 and my hands will probably still be cold? can't do it.

the sheets/glasses/plates/housewares/rugs - semi-reasonably priced, only because sheets are kind of pricey everywhere. plate sets/glasses usually have great modern/retro design and are unique.

the kitsch - great. if i need a quick stop to get a unique/cool/funny/silly gift for a friend for their birthday, i can usually count on this place for some magnets, a book, an ashtray, a belt buckle, or any other random thing that people don't usually buy for themselves but are fun to own.

But, allow me to ramble on. 

I've only been into this store a handful of times - not even enough to hold 10 fingers up. At first, I thought the vibe was cool, but then I realized that the clothing caters to a very young, modern crowd. That's fine, if you're into baby doll cardigans and skinny jeans. Initially I thought there was nothing I'd see (besides books and the oddities) that I'd want to buy. I stand corrected. My last visit I found that they offer simpler choices in t-shirts for people like me. Sure, there are still your trendy cuts and styles for those who can't live without imitating Paris Hilton or Jenny Lewis, but there are also plain colors and styles that you can mix-n-match to complement your own personal tastes. I like that about this place. I like that you can find 2 tees for $24 and 2 tanks for $20. Ain't bad. 

I haven't dared to try on any pants or jeans... or shoes, for that matter. I figure I better stick with what I know - shirts. The last thing I need is to try and slip into their jeans and find that my birthin' hips aren't all the rage. I'd like to think there's more to this world than stick figures and skinny fat chicks. Oh, no offense to those with boyish figures. I just know that when I walk into Urban, the chances of me finding anything that a) I like and b) that fits is, oh, 23%. That's not to say I'm complaining. I accept that Urban caters to a younger crowd. That doesn't mean I can't mosey around once in a while hoping to be proven wrong.

On the other hand, I bet my Shirley Manson collection that my 14 year old sis would go wild in Urban. I wouldn't want to be the one fitting that bill.

This store has always attracted me for some reason.....maybe because it seems like a piece of history or something. There aren't too many upscale department stores left in mid-town Phoenix anymore. In fact none that I can even think of. It's great not having to drive out to the 'burbs somewhere to go shopping at a nice department store. I'm glad this store has survived.

Like I said, I went shopping late Friday night so there weren't a whole lot of people in the store so it was VERY relaxing to shop and browse. 

I decided to get a Macy's credit card and approached a service desk. Literally within 2 minutes I had an account and was ready to go. I know it's the age of technology but getting a credit account at 9:15 on a Friday night in two minutes is pretty cool.

Did some more shopping....I mean I had a 20% discount now with the new credit card (discount good for two days once you've opened an account). Got some pretty good deals on the clearance racks.

And yes, it's pricey...but it's Macy's. Who doesn't expect to pay more at a department store? TJ Maxx and Marshalls are great options to find discounted clothing....but some of the deals on the Macy's clearance racks were just as good.

There were several reviews of this location criticizing the slow service. Didn't get that at all. Granted they weren't busy but the staff was all exceptionally nice and pleasant. Someone was always asking if I needed help, and yes, that can sometimes get annoying but they did it in such a pleasant manner that it wasn't bothersome. They were just trying to do their job. 

One employee was exceptionally nice. He saw that I had just opened a new credit account and went out of his way to welcome me to the Macy's 'family.' It's stuff like that makes paying  extra sometimes worth it. 

Bought a few items and was out by 9:40 or so.

Yes, you have to give them props for longevity, the parade in NYC, Miracle on 34th St.....etc....but companies simply cannot rest on their laurels and assume that bad service is ever OK.  Which leads me to why I'm reviewing this location and giving 2 stars.

When me mums was out for Thanksgiving a few weeks ago we went there because she wanted to look at some things for Xmas gifts.  I drove her there and went along for the ride. While we were in the jewelry section she commented on a few items she liked and I made mental notes to come back and stock up for Xmas for her (after she'd left town).  When I went back I was astounded by the rudeness of the employees/disinterest in actually helping customers.

After several searching for a sales associate in the jewelry area for about 5 minutes with no one in sight, finally a middle aged white lady appeared in the fine jewelry section. She sort of hid behind a display and when I finally made eye contact with her she seemed completely put off by the fact that I had a question about jewelry.  I told & showed her what I was looking for, but in a different size and when she asked if I was looking for gold and I explained no, silver...she rolled her eyes and wafted me away with her hand back towards the ""cheap"" jewelry. 

Fortunately for me (and Macy's) a lovely lady named Shell appeared and rushed over to help me, (despite the fact that I was ""only"" looking at $100 necklaces in silver).    She was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about her inventory, made some recommendations and showed me several pieces.  I ended up getting the $100 necklace AND a pair of earrings from her and she was more than happy to help me, ring me up with me a smile and at least redeem Macy's momentarily.  Shell rocks and should be promoted.  The other lady should get the stick outta her choochoo and stop pretending she works at Tiffany's.

On the way out I passed mens fragrance and inquired about some product for my roomie.  The snotty little fashionista twink sales associate scoffed at my inquiry and and rolled his eyes and I thought I better get outta Macy's before my Shell-induced glow waned any further.

All said, I got what I came for and have arranged some nice Xmas gifts for mom, but my overall experiences at Macy's mainly serve to solidify why I abhor the mall, large retail chains and would prefer to shop local indie.","review","hno-5CTo24tD9YRdglAZ2g",1,2,5,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Phoenix","AZ","Clothing"

If you can swing by the location at Fashion Square, I would suggest them over this one any day.  My experiences only extend to the fine jewelry, watches, makeup, handbag, shoes, petites, and home departments, but I have heard some positive things about the men's section.

The primary issue for me tends to be the customer service... or usually, unfortunately, the lack there of.  Even when there aren't many customers around, the salespeople tend to be very snippy and hasty with any questions I have had.  Waiting in line to purchase my items, I would like to be recognized but tend to feel as though I am inconveniencing them by merely being in line.  As a regular shopper on the whole, it leaves a rather negative taste in my mouth and instead of my usual perusing, I find myself trying to get in and out of there as fast as possible.

I think housewares is probably the weakest section of the store I have encountered due to the fact that the only way to find someone to assist you is to go to the registry area because there are never any associates anywhere other than there as well as the children's department.  Even help with purchasing items for a registry was a pain and I ended up going for a drive to Fashion Square to complete it.  Granted, it isn't the sales department's fault that their selection is so tiny, I was looking for someone to even offer to check or call another store for me and that service was not extended even after asking for it.

The overall selection at Fashion Square is much better and the sales team is much stronger.

While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.","review","cRyNICH0mhjxagvSyVr60Q",1,3,8,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Phoenix","AZ","Clothing"

The staff has been hit or miss, but selection has always been decent.  That is... until today.

I had some time to spare after an afternoon meeting nearby, so I decided to stop by and check out their latest sale.  I was in the market for both myself and my almost one year old son.  I stopped by the shoe section first and was disappointed to see that many of the brands that they used to carry were no longer there.  I was not impressed with the shoe selection at all.  So, on to clothes.  I did find a couple of shirts that I liked: Free People and Splendid specifically (and bonus - there's a decent sale going on, but you do have to go through racks of stuff to find the gems).  But they no longer carry Trina Turk and the quality of what they do carry seemed much cheaper than I remembered.  I also asked a couple of sales people for help and they were not friendly at all.  From there, I went up to the third level to check out the kids' department.  Selection was not good there either; at least for boys.  They had a few cute Carter's pajamas sets and some Ralph Lauren stuff, but nothing amazing that I had to buy.

So, for a department store, Macy's is A-OK, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I much prefer Nordstrom's now for my department store shopping!  

PS - I'm by no means a shopping snob, so I hope the above doesn't come off that way.

The friends and family discount is the only one that can be used for certain watches, including Emporio.  The sales assistant was wonderful and even sold me on the extended service plan.  The plan even includes lifetime battery replacement.  I have about 5 armanis and when the watch batteries die, its at least 20-50 smackers per pop.  The $19.99 service agreement was a deal!  I hardly ever buy them.  To top off this wonderful service sundae, she even removed the links on the watch.  This was something they did not do in the past.  Lastly, she asked me to send my friends her way.  I loved that.  Not many businesses ask you to refer them to your friends for additional business.

So this location has appealed to me in that it's kind of a stand-alone entity. You don't have to walk through a bunch of stuff to get to it. The parking (depending on when you go) has on many occasions offered me rock star quality spots so that alone gives them an extra star in my book. 

But yesterday, the unthinkable, the unimaginable happened. 

As you may have noticed, due to the 110+ temps going on right now, we are fully planted in swimsuit season. I, call me weird if you want, am not a fan of shopping for swimsuits. I feel that every dessert, every chip, every carb you've ever eaten comes to haunt you during swimsuit season. 

I marched into Macy's (having another one of their screaming deal sales), grabbed 5 swimsuits (mentally prepared to leave the dressing room in tears) and lo and behold, I fell in love with two of them. TWO SWIMSUITS IN ONE DAY! Did you hear that?!? That was the sound of my ample tookus falling on the floor in shock. That sort of miracle only happens for the fit-bodied or the blessed people who don't care what they look like in a swimsuit. Not for the people like me. The people who know what it's like to be continuously self-conscious, when-did-I-get-backfat, I'm pretty sure that isn't supposed to jiggle, why can't I wear a wetsuit instead so I can cover this flubber...Macy's pulled off a miracle yesterday. I left there feeling pretty damned sexy. That's worth 2 more stars. 

The final star is for the super sales they have for me whenever I show up. If you want a discount, all you have to do is ask. If you're from out of town, tell the cashier and they usually have a discount for that too. Or maybe that star is for the great shoe selection. It's not my favorite shoe store, but it's definitely my favorite in my neighborhood.","review","2KNPtV5E44vAiEr5BvMkUA",4,5,3,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Phoenix","AZ","Clothing"

Their shoe staff is helpful and will even look up shoes for you off the clearance rack (most store staff don't even care what you think if you're buying off the clearance rack) to see if another size/color is at another store.

I would say the only department they lack in is the Lingerie department... tried to find wedding lingerie for a friend and Dillard's had much better selection and variety.","review","A99dyhEqcd_yXKPfBWeZHA",1,1,1,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Chandler","AZ","Clothing"

You can beat a good Macy's clearance.......period. Move over Kohls, when Macy's is having a sale you simply can't beat the price and quality of the items that you find.

The INC line is my favorite and it is VERY closely followed by the great selection of Coach products that they carry. I have never seen so much Coach on sale as I have at seen at this location.

I am a new fan of the Martha Stewart home stuff that Macy's carries! Nice high quality bake ware and bedding!

Staff is friendly and helpful and the store doesn't seem to ever be over crowded. I also love the Starbucks Coffee Shop that they have at this location!

Only thing I could say is a con to this particular location is that their women's clothing department is lacking. Since the store is smaller than the other nearby locations they obviously can't hold as much.

I was in need of a very specific item, a black chunky belt to go with a specific outfit. First off I could not find an associate to ask were I could find accessories let alone a black belt.

I eventually figured that the belts would probably be somewhere around the jewelry or the purses so I made my way over to the jewelry department. Eventually I found the belts in a very small corner by the purses. The organization was horrible and I probably should have just looked elsewhere but I was running out of time and I just need this particular item. So I started looking through the belts and low and behold I found a gem on clearance. This is where the real issue began.

I made my way over to the nearest counter that I found and no one was around. I went to look around the accessory department to see if I could locate an associate. No one to be found. I saw one associate assisting a customer with a purse but I did not want to bug her in the middle of a sale. I figured I would just head to a nearby jewelry counter to make my purchase. I noticed an associate at the Fossil watch counter and I approached her. I asked if I could purchase the belt at her counter and she very rudely tells me that she is with another customer and she will be with me in a minute and that I should just stay put. I did not mind that she was with another customer, I fully understand that but it was the tone in which she said it that was very off putting. Also with so many other counters open at Macy's I did not understand why she could not have suggested that I maybe go to another counter.

I did decide that I did not want to deal with that attitude and took my purchase to another counter. This associate saved the purchase for me. She was very friendly, approachable and lovely. She even scanned an additional percent coupon for me that she did not even have to do. So bottom line here that I learned is that there are certain people at this location of Macy's who do not make a judgment on the purchase you are making who are more than willing to help you and also those who hate their job and cannot wait until you leave. Your experience will vary depending on which associate you are assisted by.","review","ZWdsr06AvPgDzahZQ7hd2g",1,0,4,"Macy's","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Men's Clothing","Chandler","AZ","Clothing"

One time, after I finished shopping and about to leave the store the alarm went off. I stood around and no one came to check the security for me. The girls at the cosmetic department were just hanging around. I had my 2 year old sitting in a $20 stroller with Macys shopping bags on one handle, and the other handle has my open tote w/ no zipper. No one is approaching, so I had to do it myself, $260 worth of cheap clothes so there were 12-15 items, I forgot. After I checked and made sure no security tags I proceed to leave the store. As I was leaving an associate came and stopped me and wanted to check my bags. I told her I checked already and I'm ok. She insisted on going through my bags just to make sure. I told her I have to go pick up my daughter as it was approaching 2:30. She said that it's policy and insinuated that I have unpaid items. I got frustrated because I stood around and had to do the security work myself and no one helped for like 2-3 minutes and now this?? I was so mad I told her to take everything back bc I have to leave. This associate knew I was in a hurry and dragged the procedure. I used to work for department stores and I'm positively sure that when the alarm goes off, all associates are to be alerted and proceed to the help with shoppers' bags. After the incidence, I called the store and explained the whole situation. I'm pretty sure they reviewed the cameras and sent me two $25 gift certificate.

After working countless Black Friday's myself, if anyone is sympathetic to associates and the perspective of the employees, it would be me. 

But, nothing excuses the fact that there is clearly lack of talent available on the sales floor for YES, one of the highest traffic days your store will see all year. Or the fact that the store is so obviously terribly understaffed, or horribly scheduled, that the trash in every part of the store is overflowing with cups and food items- SO disgusting. There was no recovery going on. Thanks, the evening shopper definitely was not treated and welcomed into the store the way I'm sure they welcomed their 6pm shopper on Thanksgiving Day. Perhaps that is what happens to profit-hungry, lack-of-connecting with-customer companies when they put their own ideas of success before their employees needs. It was utterly a disaster and you don't even have to work in retail to see that was the case.

I walked in, fully prepared and willing to deal with any lines, tired associates, etc. I had done my research ahead of time, no dilly-dallying, in and out, they can have the commission, I get my couch, done deal. Walking in being greeted by that messy and trash-infested disaster should have been my first cue. Walking thru the home appliances and home goods area was a nightmare in progress......you don't have open boxes of knives on the level where kids can reach- seriously. SMH. I waited in the furniture area for 20 minutes before I finally went up to the one associate and asked for help. She was in the corner, working with one couple while at least 15 other people milled around. Lack of coverage, lack of sales, lack of profit- great equation Macy's. 

Yep, I walked in, and walked out- no sale. At least the parking lot wasn't full (natch). Not even gonna try another store- online with this Brand forever.

1.  Experience -Been to this place for a long time and have spent each year at least 1000-1500.

2.  Selection - I am hard on clothes and travel alot. The quality of their products I am very happy with. You have to spend a bit to get quality stuff.

3.  Quality - Their own brand, Pronto Uomo, is very good overall and will wear well and look great. You cannot go wrong here.

4.  Tailoring - They will tailor and alter everything to fit you perfectly, and once you tailor something, you can have it altered in future for free.

5.  Service - Their current staff is not up to task unfortunately. I have gone there three times to order the same shoes I purchased there before. They did not have it in stock, so they called to another store and had it sent to their store. They would put me on a list to call and then never call me. I would call in and they do not call back. I waited 4 weeks and finally ordered it on-line from Amazon and got it in 3 days. They lost my sale. I wanted to buy from Men's Wearhouse, but they didn't care.

6.  Tux Rental - I am afraid that you will have no choice but to use them as they are the largest and most recognized in town. However they suffer from not being organized, not having a good process for customer service and not helping the long lines properly. They have a numbering and sign in sheet, and only half of the staff will work it, while the others just help whomever shows up. Iris the manager will bypass it and then when you complain, she ignores you. You will see 10 people waiting to get fitted for tuxedos, and 7 staff, with only 3 of them working the tux people. Yet all 7 at one time you will see help others with tux fittings, so it is odd to see more than 50% of the staff standing around at the front desk jabbering while the client line is not worked....

7.  I got frustrated there and mentioned my concerned which led to the staff person helping me there simply going on break immediately without advising me, the manager ignoring me, and one kind staff helping me.

I do not enjoy spending thousands at a store yearly and then they treat me like this, so I will not be back, but for all of you, the quality of selection, and the knowledge of the staff has been good up till 2010, so maybe they just do not like me.

When I go suit shopping, I'm usually dropping between $500-$1000.  That doesn't make me the biggest spender in the world, but it's a good chunk of change to spend in a mid-level men's formal wear shop.  And it's not peanuts to me, so when I come in looking to spend that money,  I expect a little attention from the staff and some advice.  They're really not good at attention or advice at this Men's Wearhouse l,ocation.  That hasn't been my experience at all of their stores, but this one is particularly bad.

I stopped in 2 different times to look at buying a few suits.  The first time I stopped in, no one greeted me or asked if I needed help.  But to be fair, the staff looked like they were helping a fair amount of customers looking to rent tuxedos.  So I figured I'd just come back when they weren't so busy.

The next time I came in, a woman offered to help me.  We talked about what I wanted (classic gray business suit) and she took me over to the section of suits in my size.  After a minute of looking, she just told me, ""Looks like we don't have one in"" and walked off.  The store wasn't that busy.  She walked back to the register and talked with other staff.

This is by far the WORST store I have ever been to. Customer service is awful. There were about 5 associates on the floor chatting it up when we arrived and when we were finally acknowledged (because we said something, due to a lack of attention), we were told we would have to make an appointment and come back another  time. When we commented that no one was in the store, so could we just take care of this now, we got a big eye roll and an ""okay."" Let me just clarify that we spent approximately 40 minutes in the store and no one else came in for assistance. This leads me to believe they had no big rush coming, so there was no reason why we couldn't be helped in the first place. 

Then we were lied to at least three times. First, about the price of a child's tux (I discovered this lie, because I called their corporate number to verify the price because it made no sense). Second, when our groomsmen went in to pick up their tuxes, they were emphatically told that sleeves on the jacket should end about an inch above your wrist when your arms are down at your side. Umm, we didn't order tuxes for a Pee Wee Herman inspired wedding. Lastly, when I asked to speak with the manager, I was told she had left for the day. When I called corporate, and told them what was said (during the same conversation about the child's tux), they checked the time the manager checked out. Of course, I wasn't given any confidential info, but I was told that the manager did not check out of that store until 7 that evening. We were there around 4 pm.

When I finally spoke to the manager, she had an excuse for everything and was extremely flippant with me on the phone as well as in person.

Bottom line: If you want to add a big headache to your day, and even your event, this is the place to go!","review","hQokhLziV7Y3LJyR7io7Cg",0,0,0,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

I had tried on my tuxedo that I bought about 10 years ago. I found that the waistband needed to be let out ( it must have shrunk in the closet). I had a wedding coming up in less than one week with travel beginning in 2 days. Not alot of time to allow for the alteration. I walked into the store Sunday afternoon of the 4th of July weekend. The store was crowded with lots of customers. An employee who was helping another customer smiled at me and said I'll be right with you. He had to have seen that I was carrying a pair of tuxedo pants and therefore unlikely to buy anything. Sure enough within 3 minutes he came over to ask how he could help me. I explained my problem and he told me that the alterations department was overwhelmed because it's a holiday weekend. However after hearing what my problem was , he said he would be able to make it work. After marking up the pants, he told me to come back tomorrow after 6 p.m. When I called on Monday afternoon, I was told that the pants were ready. Not only were the parents waiting for me, they were pressed and altered perfectly. Store had outstanding customer service, excellent workmanship, service with a smile. A special shout out to Daniel Hernandez who made sure all of this went perfectly well. 
PS: because I had purchased the tuxedo from Mens Wearhouse, there was no charge for the alteration even though it was 10 years before.","review","nVXGSCdCoLkt0nUQ2gJDAw",0,0,0,"Men's Wearhouse","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Formal Wear","Henderson","NV","Clothing"

Ever since I was a little girl, I remember going to this exact salon with my grandmother to get her hair done. Well now the tradition will live on through me as I have found my most favorite hairdresser I have ever had.

I have been going to this salon for over a year, but I recently got a new hairdresser for 2010 due to some scheduling conflicts, and she has been AMAZING. Candee is really cool, laid back, has awesome hair (shouldn't every hairdresser have that??) and just has a 6th sense about what he customers will love and will flatter them the most. I had been getting my hair in a pixie cut since October, but until I had her I only knew of how to style it in one way, and now I have a lot more options. She gives great opinions on what products to use and I always make sure to reschedule. Usually JCPenney will have contests too if you reschedule for a free haircut which is super nice. I have yet to win, but the option is there! Also on the receipt they give you there is a survey for 15% off your next in-store purchase which if you take it, it will also help out your hairdresser to get awards. You give some, you get some!

Overall this salon is very neat and tidy, and if you do happen to get something other than your hair done, their salon in the back for waxing, etc. is GORGEOUS. Total ambiance, very relaxing, and neat and professional. The price is always reasonable and I have never left that salon unhappy especially now that I have Candee as my main hairdresser. I go once every 4 weeks like clockwork and always look forward to it. My hair has never looked better in any other hands and if you get the right person I know you will love this salon as much as I do!","review","6d6PyGPyiw_mAcA030Cyng",2,2,2,"JCPenney","Women's Clothing,Department Stores,Fashion,Shopping,Baby Gear & Furniture","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

This particular store is 2 floors and they have a vast selection of almost anything you need. 

My mother and I went to check out, and lo and behold they had an extra deal involving scratchcards that would get you an extra 15, 20, or 30% off.

This location wasn't that busy even though it is in the heart of the University City shopping center.  Other than being a little bit tucked into the parking lot near the pond that everything is clustered around, you can easily see the sign from Tryon as you are driving North or South.

This store is located across the street from Boardwalk Billy's and that whole area, so it could be a bit trafficy. The store is pretty big and had plenty of new clothes to browse, all at the expected prices. However, the men's clearance section was pretty much non-existent, with the exception of five ""Trekkie"" shirts (unfortunately I'm more a Star Wars guy myself, so these were not tantalizing.) This was definitely the least amount of men's clearance I've ever come across at an Old Navy. On the other hand, the missus made out like a bandit and found a ton of stuff in her clearance section, and had a tough time deciding what to take and what to leave behind.

I personally wouldn't want to come back to this location for myself, but for the woman of the house it's still a decent clothing stop if you're in the area.","review","iXpKKeeiXjBncJyDWbfhxw",0,0,1,"Old Navy","Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

1. Nobody greets you when you walk in. (Customer Service 101).
2. You can walk around for 15 minutes with an armful of clothing and nobody will ask you if you need a fitting room. (Customer service 101 & Loss Prevention 101).
3. Nobody will come by the fitting room to see how you're doing and if you need alternate sizes. (Customer Service 101, Loss Prevention 101 & Sales 101). 

I've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before. (Grammar 101). I started as a Gap Inc. employee in 1996 working my way up from Gap Baby to Gap Kids, Gap and finally Banana Republic in 2009. I worked as a sales associate, a visual specialist and most recently men's merchant in Arizona. The three times I've been here the store has always been in disarray which certainly doesn't create for a very stimulating shopping experience and the uninterested staff have made it so I'll simply only shop online now.

I will say over the holiday season they are a bit better but that is to be expected.

I was in the store shopping for my husband and nephew. In one hand I had bags from purchases made at other stores, and in my other arm I was juggling my purse, a fountain drink, and a shirt I was planning to purchase in-store.  I didn't have a free hand to shop, so I approached a young sales rep at a register in the men's department and politely asked her if I could have a paper shopping bag (the one with handles) so I could merge my stuff into one bag and free up a hand to shop.  She hesitated while looking me up and down and then informed me that I would have to make a purchase before I could have a bag.  I was irritated that Macy's couldn't spare a .20 cent bag to ease my Christmas shopping experience but I was even more incensed at the way the sales rep looked at me, as though I was going to try to stuff something in the bag I hadn't paid for.  Obviously, with a Dillards bag and a Disney store bag in hand I was making purchases that day.   I put the shirt back on the rack that I was planning to buy and left the store and finished my shopping for the boys at Dillards and Dicks.

I am a business professional and I work in sales.  The entire sales team in our company just finished reading ""The Customer Rules"" by Lee Cockerell.  I recommend Macy's invest in a similar plan for their sales team.  They need to learn how to create a welcome environment for their customers and go above & beyond to provide exemplary service.

You can even come back to the store anytime and get your suit steam pressed for free after you buy a suit here!

There is a wide range of fitted shirts and ties to choose from and they lay everything out for you as if you were wearing it to get a picture of how it ties together.  They really tackle the thing some men hate most like myself... shopping for clothes.

For every $500 you spend you get a $50 credit towards anything in the store which is great, you really get quality products here for a fair price + many incentives.

Then I chose debit and entered my pin. she grabbed the card out of my hand and was like give me your ID

On this trip I had $30 in Kohls Cash and a 30% off coupon burning a hole in my purse.  I also needed a new vacuum cleaner (which they carry).  
I find that you are pretty much on your own at any Kohls I have ever been to, as the Customer Service Reps are usually focused at registers.  Also I have found that baskets here come at a premium.  When looking for ways to get my vacuum cleaner up to the front register I had to suck up my embarassment as I utilized a double kid carrying cart just to use the basket portion to load my vacuum and carry it to the register and later to my car. This cart was like 8' long....

All their stores have the same four sided setup so it is easy to navigate and find things.  In some ways you see a Target wanna be, since they have added many Food Network produces and star related tie-ins.  But, this is a good thing and not a bad thing.  In many instances the prices are lower that Walmart's and that is saying something!

A button popped off. Everything just seemed to be cheaply made and didn't last longer than 3 or 5 wears. Sure, you think you are getting a bargain, but $10 for a shirt you can only wear 3 times isn't that great. (I did recently purchase some Levi's from here and they are still holding up, but that could be because they are Levi's.) My recent excursion here I didn't find what I was looking for (checkered/flannel top) and left within ten minutes. This place always seems to be dead or filled with a much older crowd.

I love you, I really do.  I'm brand-loyal to you since we were both born and raised in the glorious suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, However, my affection for you dwindled just a wee bit a few days ago after an unfavorable experience. (sniff!) 

You got me with the $15 Kohl's Cash along with the 20% off coupon during your lovely annual Thanksgiving sale.  Man, I went to town purchasing kitchen, bathroom, and small electronic necessities on Kohls.com.  After my shopping binge was said and done, I had earned a whopping $135 in Kohl's Cash.  Score!  .....Then I went to town again purchasing a cookie sheet and luxury bed sheets for my condo.  

Everything was fine and dandy as my shipments came in batches (some much earlier than expected--woohoo!) I made an error when purchasing the cookie sheet and bed sheets online and needed to return them.  Here's where the heartache came:  because $45 in Kohl's Cash was used to purchase these items, I got almost NOTHING in return for them!  

----------------------

The moral of this story is that Kohl's Cash is a use-it-or-lose-it situation.  Be VERY certain you are going to keep the items you purchase with Kohl's Cash or else you are left with nothing.

I reported it to the store manager and I have yet to hear a solution from her.  She did mention that another customer could have returned it on the wrong card but the ring was secured to the card with a plastic device and it was really hard to cut off with scissors.

The buyers (those who buy clothing for a store) are completely out of touch with the number of items a store should be stocked with, and when the trucks show up, it's a crap shoot as to what might be unloaded.
Last time I was there, just a few days ago, some of the vests and bow ties were torn apart. That is if one could even find vests and bow ties.

I got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. Yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal.  Last night I found a pair of M-N-G (Mango) jeans for $5. FIVE DOLLARS! And they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring Levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department.

Fashion-wise, having lived in Europe for 3 years I can say with confidence that the M-N-G line that Mango is doing for Penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the UK and Europe (I kept noticing this on trips to the US). They've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of Target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well.

You find your items on the website (there are reviews for most things, also appreciated), order and pay for them, and have them sent to the Penney's of your choice. If you get more than $25 of merchandise they ship to the store for free. You waltz in to any register and give them your info (you need your phone number and the credit card you used, if I remember right), then they get on the walkie-talkie and have somebody bring your bag/box to the register.

I have been a long time shopper of the south park location but has never really bought much of anything from the store, I think I own more non-clothing items than clothing-items from them. Reason being, I feel like even the sale items are not affordable enough. However, I spotted some great clearance items today and picked up 2 dresses and a skirt. 

My best experience was the fitting room. The lady who was working the fitting room(blonde, wavy long hair, petite, tan) was very courteous. I can easily say it is the top 3 fitting room experiences I've had in my life. She greeted me immediately after I walked into the fitting room area, took the clothes off my hands. Then she hung my clothes up in different sections in the room. Asked for my name, introduced herself and wrote my name outside the door and told me if i needed a different size or something to go with any piece, just let her know. Now, everything up until now may seem pretty standard for an athro experience, however...after being in the room for about 5 min, she checked on me by calling me by my first name, asked if i have any clothes i do not want and wants to take out from the fitting room...that is very nice of her, who doesn't want a less cramped space? lastly, when i was finally done with trying out my clothes, she was still very pleasant, said it was a pleasure and smiled the whole time. Let me just say, I am sure working the fitting room can be QUITE annoying, so she is definitely very good at it, I wish I could tip her!

This location is smaller than the northlake location, mainly that is why they were running such a great sale, to clear out room for new items.","review","6PO3R6ZUw8r6WfRnzlexnA",1,1,2,"Anthropologie","Fashion,Shopping,Home Decor,Home & Garden,Kitchen & Bath,Women's Clothing","Charlotte","NC","Clothing"

I always come back.","review","EA4DUm9DW20r3No1sixMbg",0,1,0,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"

I really enjoyed their sticker in their window which read ""I like America and America Likes Me"" which not only made me feel mildly patriotic, but also made me happy because I'm assuming it has to be in reference to Joseph Beuys, who I'm sure you all love as much as I do.","review","R2Pt2kZTrONyedI0-65FWg",0,0,0,"American Apparel","Women's Clothing,Men's Clothing,Fashion,Shopping,Accessories","Las Vegas","NV","Clothing"
