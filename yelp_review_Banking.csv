Well surprise surprise... Arizona still has drive up tellers... That kicks azz! I miss these in California. None the less they also have an ATM island to conduct your bidness at afterhours or if the drive thru is busy.

Pro Tip: Drive thru, walk in, or ATMs who could ask for more?

Well we had a quick n easy trip to this branch. Friendly, lots of AC inside I would imagine (we didn't go in), easy to navigate drive through lanes. What more do you need?

How about a quick n easy transaction and we were in and out and didn't have to leave the car. Talk about nice and wonderfully easy. Great quickie trip to the bank.

I am not writing about this branch specifically, I am writing about EVERY one I have been in within the last year or so. I have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it. The only interaction I ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that's it. It should be so simple, but for some reason it NEVER is! Whether I drive up or walk in, it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank I have ever been to. For reals, it takes me about 5-7 minutes (yes I have timed it) once I am at the teller window. 

So today, I walk in and hand over my check and my slip. After a looooong pause (and way more typing than I believe is required to process my deposit) she asks me to confirm my home address, NOT the business address on the account. I do it, realizing later that I just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail. Then she asks me to confirm my name... yes my name. I do it. She then asks me to sign the check right below where I have clearly written ""For Deposit Only"" and the account number. I do it. Looooooooong pause........ more typing.

I have been with Wells Fargo for 4 years. here is my list of postitives and negatives.

positives:
- 24 hr customer service
- great online banking
- many locations
- text banking
- free checking for students
-upgraded to the next free checking account and now i get free checks too!
- AWESOME savings plans. you can set goals, time limits, auto transfers and it will tell you how close you are to your savings goal. i LOVE this feature.


negatives:
- you have to have your account number (not your debit card number) when you call. maybe im crazy for not having it memorized but it's a pain in the butt
- they charge you for the phone call if they think you could have been able to handle it online yourself( if you call and complain they will usually take care of it)
- there is a $10 transfer fee if you move money from your accounts too frequently or if they need to pull from your savings for overdraft protection
- when i first opened my account i was ready to start building my credit score but had really young credit and they wouldn't give me a student card without paying a huge down payment first. i went elsewhere to open my first credit card but it would have been nice to have them all on one website. Chase ended up taking a chance on me and I have been with them for a few years now(credit card wise, not checking!) and have been satisfied.",0.911945876305453,0.0678571295567859,0.0201969941377606,"review","hFtlFksrcLaWHGPNa6SmeA",3,3,4,98

They illegally seized ALL of my and my children's' accounts - some of which contained my children's death benefits and my retirement fund deposits in them, which is against federal law. The Texas judge who fired off the order immediately reversed the order and apologized for the mistake AND also said that what Bank of America did was against federal law. So, Bank of America returned our money after about a week but Bank of America has decided to keep $100 dollars for ""legal fees"" and $10 from an overdraft protection fee that cleaned out a savings account when the order was issued. Even the SS agents say this act of seizing death benefits done by Bank of America was illegal in the first place ""but this happens all the time with Bank of America"" they said. 

Oh, I talked to every manager I could at the Bank of America legal department in California until I reached AJ, who said he was at the top of the legal department. He bluntly said, ""we are keeping your money"".

Well Bank of America, you won your $110 for now but you lost 7 accounts already by us closing our accounts to keep you from doing further illegal things to us. I will continue to recommend that people make other banking arrangements to protect themselves from the predatory ways of the Bank of America legal department.

The expansion actually wasn't to the inside, however (at least as far as I know), it was to the outside.  The added several lines to the drive-through.  In a bit of a strange turn, the drive-through lanes are all two deep.  That means that there is someone in the front and someone in the back.  So if you get in the back you'll have to wait until the front person is done.  Think of a gas station, only you can't pull out until they are done.  Even the ATM drive through has two positions.

A while ago, I came to this branch just to deposit a check. I don't know what it is with the Wells Fargo branches in Las Vegas, but there seems to be a serious lack of envelope-free ATMs here. I guess I was spoiled when living in Southern California. I rarely had to step into the bank because any check deposited through those envelope-free ATMs would post to your account the same day and the funds would be available immediately.

Anyway, I'll be nice and not name the teller and personal banker that helped me that day. They were trying to get me to open another account with them. I had to stand there and listen to them explain how every customer should have 5-6 different accounts under their name because of security reasons, all those scams going on, etc., etc. Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to say and believe me, if I was a millionaire and had nothing better to do, I would love to put all that money in 10 different accounts. But it was a busy day for me, I had tons of stuff to do, and I really didn't have time to hang out at the bank. So I politely declined, thanked them for the information and told them that I would definitely keep that in mind. A few days later I noticed that they opened 2 new accounts under my name without my permission! WTF?! I called the branch and talked to the manager. She was actually very nice, apologized to me, got everything resolved and told me that she would have a talk with those two employees.

Long lines, huge hassles, and employees not fit to be working at a fast food joint.  I had a nice employee once.  Literally, once.  Every other time, my transactions are brutally trying.

I closed my personal account years ago after getting the run-around at their downtown Glendale location.

When I opened an account for my class at this particular location (only because I had to), the business accounts employee looked mortified when I handed her a couple hundred dollars in cash to deposit.  And she almost wouldn't take the change because it wasn't in rolls until I explained the idiocy of asking me to do this when there wasn't enough of each coin to make a complete roll.  Then, she kept miscounting the amount and telling me my deposit number was wrong because she couldn't understand the concept of a $2 bill.  Thankfully, she's not there anymore because she got promoted. Yup, promoted.

I had to call the 800-number to try to get an untrustworthy person's credit cards canceled on one of our accounts.  Guess what they told me?  That they couldn't cancel him unless they had the number on the card, but we didn't have the cards with the numbers on them in our possession, thus the reason behind wanting them canceled.  After I pointed out the ridiculousness of this policy all I got was ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.""

I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

Las Vegas, NV 89147.   

I just got back form being screwed by this bank, seeing as I'm not a customer there, but simply went in to cash a check drawn on their bank.  After ten minutes of ID's, data entry by the teller, thumb printing, etc.  they were ready to cash the check and then they tell me there's a $7.50 fee to do that.  I said that's ridiculous, as the check is drawn on their bank, and the teller manager Ruth Martinez tells me that the fee is NOT a Wells Fargo fee, but a fee that goes to the company who issued the check. LIES! I asked her twice about that statement and she lied both times.  I then called the company that issued the check, and sure enough there is no ""fee"" that goes to them.  Ruth refused to speak to them to hear it from their own lips. I asked that they waive the $7.50 charge, which is totally in their power to do so.  She said no.  I then waited for the branch manager who basically said the same thing. 

Sooooo, for $7.50 they will get bad press (deservedly so), I will never bank with them or go in their branches again, and I'll relate this story to all who will listen.  On a final note, there is a great employee there named Andrew who was very helpful.  You'd think in the era of supposed ""customer service"" it wouldn't be worth receiving a scathing review for $7.50.

I've banked at Bank of America for 25 years, and any problems that have arisen have been handled right away.  I know others haven't had the same experience, but I think they are much better than most.

This Wells Fargo is located off Silverado and Bermuda.  This is also one of the busier ones inside since it's fairly close to Las Vegas Blvd and in a busy shopping center.  

My biggest issues with this location is;

1.  No drive thru ATM.  There's a drive thru, but it's for El Pollo Loco.  I've been fooled the first time I came out here and thought I was in a ATM drive thru to find it out that it's for El Pollo.  As a result, found myself ordering some chicken. 

2.  The lines during the day are crazy long and it seems they take forever at this location. I know exactly why the lines here are long and you can thank guys like my brother-in-law that will only take money out of his own bank to avoid additional chargers. I probably spend more money on gas than the $2 additional charge.  

I get my hair cuts at the Xpress Cuts located in the same parking lot. So, I really have no choice about hitting this Wells every once in awhile.

Started an account and wanted a higher interest rate so I chose a Market rate SAVINGS account. The bank manager set me up with over-draft protection and I went home happy.

Got an over-draft fee. WTF.

Called the customer service number. Was told that my bank account was not eligible for over-draft protection because it was actually a checking account called a Market Rate SAVINGS account. The fees stood. WTF.

Received a notice in the mail (from BOA I thought) saying that there had been a lawsuit for over-draft fees. 

Called the customer service number again. Spoke with an agent who cheerfully remarked ""oh, that's silly that your account isn't set up for over-draft protection. Let me take care of that"" and refunded me the fees.

Got an over-draft charge. WTF.

Called and explained that I had been told by a rep that my account was eligible for over-draft protection. Was accused of lying because the system said that the fees had been refunded based on a ""courtesy"" as opposed to a ""bank error"", talked through the most laughable investigative process and told that the fees stood - there was nothing I could do to change it.

Do not do business with these liars and thieves.)

I was offered a loan modification, were misinformed about process and our payment was increased instead of reduced. Caused us to file for bankruptcy.

One year after I bought my house, I received a notification that there was a mistake with escrow the way my mortgage was written, and that my payment was increasing by nearly $200. This was not something I was capable of doing, I signed a specific mortgage to make a specific payment. So, in 2010 I applied for and was considered for a loan modification, after signing on with a third party agent who failed to perform any of his duties and forced us to file a lawsuit, we contacted BofA directly who finally claimed to get the unfinished paperwork processed and started the modification process.

The first packet we receive for our three month ""trial"" period stated a new payment that was an INCREASE of approximately $300. I called specifically about this and arranged an in-person meeting with one of their loan modification specialists at one of their corporate centers in my home city of Phoenix. I was assured every time that this increase in payment would not be permanent and it was a direct result of being behind on my payments. I reluctantly accepted this, and forced my way through the further burden on my finances. 

After my three month trial period, I received my final paperwork. Contrary to everything I was assured by every level of employee at Bank of America I could contact, the $300 increase was, in fact, permanent. Managers I contacted to complain behaved as if they were doing me a favor because despite the $300 increase, the months I was behind were being forgiven.

So, they were basically telling me I could accept the new payment and be forced to file for bankruptcy, or deny the new payment program and face foreclosure instead.

In doing this, Bank of America caused me to file for Bankruptcy in order to keep my house. And were thoroughly unapologetic and unwilling to correct this injustice.

It has been over a year now, and we have just completed our Bankruptcy and had the case closed. What do I receive in the mail? A statement from Bank of America saying I owe late fees on my mortgage payment (approximately $250) that they refuse to correct, which was a direct result of removing our mortgage from their Bankruptcy department and failing to inform us of doing so. Then, I was sent (via overnight FedEx) a packet that they claimed I requested for a Loan Modification.

When we called to complain, we were told that this was just ""mass mail"". Not only is overnight FedEx not mass mail and clearly a lie, their records should show more than clearly that I had been thoroughly through a ""Loan Modification"" program with them previously. This is a gross misappropriation of funds and just further evidence of their negligence and abuse toward their customers.

A letter of complaint was written onto their Facebook page. It was deleted with no response. Bank of America agents are unwilling to correct their own errors and rectify the abuse I have suffered by their actions. I have been mistreated time and time again by this organization and they do not care. I have finally had enough. I can provide any paperwork necessary to substantiate my claims, but it is nothing that Bank of America does not have on record.

We have filed a complaint with the BBB (CASE#: 438356), and will continue to complain to every organization we can until this is rectified. I have been abused by this organization quite enough, thank you very much.",0.917470448511186,0.0624415348541013,0.0200880166347126,"review","yJ22u_1l01H4NM3wCowIKw",0,0,2,248

All for a halfhearted apology and a bottle of water. Lovely.

Here's the thing, Wells - my mother had accounts with you for many years. My stepfather has an account with you. Had I been treated well, had I been treated with any value and respect and even a modicum of interest, I may have started an account with you. I would have been a relatively easy sell. However, not only was I not convinced I'd get stellar service if I were your customer, I was so disgusted by the horrible communication and mediocre at best service that there's no way I'd ever consider an account with you.

Granted - I am not the Sultan of Brunei or any relation to Bill Gates - the lack of my business won't effect your bottom line in any notable way.

Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) on banks funds transfer states that if there is an account number AND named beneficiary mismatch that Chase should not have allowed the wire transfer to occur. It did. The fault lies on Chase.

I understand that banks can get very busy at times, but during this particular time, there was no one in line. I went straight up to the teller, swiped my card, and gave her my savings bond to cash. It seemed like everything was running smoothly, but then a few minutes passed without her saying anything while she shuffled through her drawer, so I began to get antsy. She then told me that she ran out of cash out slips, but that was already a few minutes after she wrote across my entire savings bond, so I just kind of stared at her and said, ""ok"" because I didn't know how she wanted to solve the situation. She told me to hold on so she could try and find some, then she walked away into some other room. I figured it would only take her a couple of minutes, but I was wrong...again. She ended up taking 12 minutes (I know this because I started timing the whole process on my phone) and when she came back, she informed me that she was still unable to find any cash out slips.

 WTF! I was really annoyed at that point because I was already late to meet my boyfriend and she didn't seem to be handling the situation professionally (she NEVER apologized for the wait). Her last resort was to just stand there in front of me, shuffling through her drawer and repeating ""I can't find any"" until the teller next to her said, ""here, why don't you just use one of mine and we'll just tell the manager later."" Seriously, that took 2 seconds. These people obviously need to work on their team work, customer service, and organization skills. I literally stood there for 23 minutes waiting to have my tiny ass savings bond cashed. If she didn't completely write across it before finding out she had no cash out slips, I would've just taken it back and walked out.",0.43211152942138,0.416512822953151,0.151375647625469,"review","-K3ZjROK0ml2P-Rk7ttHzA",0,1,1,123

I nearly felt forced to give my number, so I gave it to him quickly in hopes he wouldn't hear one of the numbers.

I asked about a sign I saw on the window at the front.  It was some feature where you can scan your check and deposit it via phone.  I asked the teller if this was something that was available for the Blackberry.  Instead of knowing the answer, the teller had to search for the answer.

It is near the edge of the city's development, in the SW side, so maybe that is why there were not that many people in this branch location in the afternoon (2:30-3pm).  Which was great for me, as waiting in line is something most people would prefer to do less of.

The teller that assisted me was very friendly (only 2 were on staff at the counter when I was there), made casual conversations and attempted to get me to open a BofA account with them (after asking some questions and making an assessment to determine if the customer could benefit from opening a BofA account).  This is what all the tellers should be doing, and she did it very well.

Anyway, I did not open an account, as I was just there to deposit rent I collect on behalf of a friend.  But the entire process was quick and efficient, and service was provided by friendly staff.  So easily 4 stars.

I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . 
       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a ""bank error "" they said. You damm right there was !!
       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem.

I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.

I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.

And the drive thru tellers are usually kind at this branch. 

However, today, I sat for 30 minutes, with a grumpy toddler, waiting to be helped. And there I sat, with only one person acknowledging me. She offered my child a lollipop and kindly informed me she had an appointment with a client or she would have been happy to help me, until I decided to leave. 

Not one person, after the friendly banker, popped over to say that they were going to take a while with their current client or gave me an approximate wait time. I even approached a teller who had no customers in line, to inform them that a fellow customer and I both needed help and that we had been waiting for some time. After a quick apology from the teller and my returning to the waiting area, still no one assisted us. There was no sense of urgency from the employees.

In short, it was a very disappointing customer service experience. After a meltdown from my toddler and 30 minutes of total waiting, I needed to leave and so I did. Without an acknowledgment of my presence or of my leaving.

About 16-18 months ago (in my guess) they put up the glass (bulletproof I again guess) in between the customers and the tellers. Seems very secure to me, the glass in my estimation is about an inch thick, so all you would be robbers, beware!!! haha :)

I've been a BofA customer for years.  I started with them when I opened my first bank account in Georgia close to 15 years ago.  I stick to the ATMs and manage my accounts online whenever possible but every now and then I do need to go into the bank for a transaction of some sort.  When I do go in, it's usually Eddie at this location that I work with.  He's very professional and takes care of business for us - no problem. 

It's interesting because my husband's work and personal bank accounts are at another bank with a branch just down the street from this one.  He loves his bank, but I somehow convinced him to keep our shared account at BofA.  I've had to go to his bank for some transactions as well, and I see why he is loyal to them; it's a friendlier atmosphere over there.

Nonetheless, I'm still a loyal BofA customer and can't complain about their services at all.

Any of you (including you, BOA) can reach me at joltin@aol.com (please subject any emails, ""BOA ISSUE"" or I may not see). BOA, its people and these kind of systems are deliberately engineering the US economy to take money away from those who can least afford it. 

FIGHT BACK!!

-------------------

OMG!!!

What a ripoff!!!! They systematically steal our money in the form of government handouts and then, because they need more to fund their crooked system, come at us all individually. This is bold-faced theft and the individuals involved should really be criminally charged - yes Tara Tatro - this includes you!

Anyone know a good attorney?--seems like we might have enough for a class action. 

MICHAEL  MOORE - GOT A SUBJECT FOR YOU!!! 

My background: 
I had a $7,000 credit limit w BOA and have had zero late payments on my account for at least 2 years. During the last year I maintained a higher balance-  in the$ 6,000 area. As I've moved into cleaning up my finances, I paid off BOA. IMMEDIATELY, they lowered my credit line a crazy amount. Not to $5,000, not $3000 but to $500 dollars in July 2009 - a 93% credit line decrease!!! How can  you even pretend to justify this? In the end, they claimed that they re-reviewed my credit and this is what they came up with - despite my always paying on time. Keep in mind, my credit has had NO new negative entries in over two years!!!

What does this mean ?- It means BOA was happy has a cow to charge my 20+% interest on a 6,000 balance (about $250 per month) but then once I paid it down -restrict my access to the charge card.  WAIT A MINUTE!!! So if you accept I paid them this interest for a year, they've stolen $3,000 from me and now won't let me ( a proven paying customer) charge anything anymore. AND because they've lowered my credit line, they've lowered my credit utilization percentage and hence my further access to the credit market - think home purchase.

Can you see how they trap you?

So, I call Customer Service to complain... their response? ""Tough""... argh.... Next step, I go visit a branch to have this explained to me. The branch GM is very nice, researches it with his resources and comes back with the answer that he is sorry but doesn't know how this happened or the rationale. He asks me to let him know what I find out. 

Double ARGH!!!!! Think about that, the branch manager is asking me to figure out what's going on with this thieving company!!!

So, then I call the corporate offices in Charlotte and ask to speak to the VP of Customer Relations. The operator informs me that they can't put any callers through to any executives. Given we (taxpayers) just gave them how many zillion, this seems very strange to me I tell her. The operator is very nice says that she understood but she is systemically prevented from transferring a call or giving out a phone # for executives. 

WOW!! Its like Bank Of Darth Vader - isn't it?

So, then I try this executive customer service line (704-386-5687 - thank you Consumerist!!!). I initially get a very nice lady named Melanie who promises me that they'll be able to fix the situation. She then transfers me to a Tara Tatro (she sounds very young and is quick with the insults). When I ask her title, she tells me her title is ""works in the Office of the Chairman  & CEO"" and refuses to give me any more info.  (BTW, Did you know this exec customer service department is Tampa? Why does Ken Lewis need to have an office that reports directly to him in Tampa - Winter home???)

She looks into my file and comes back with the same answer - tough. She tells me she found something on my credit report that was late. I challenge her on this because I monitor my reports and I have a 700 score. I ask her what specifically she sees - she won't tell me. She then asks me what credit report I am looking at - I don't tell her, but ask her which one she is looking. Again she won't respond - kinda odd, particularly since my main bank just saw fit to give me a $15k unsecured line of credit - don't you think?

I mean seriously - these guys take zillions of $$s out of the economy so they can line their pockets with fat bonuses, extra homes and country club memberships.  And they cant be made available to anyone? 

I point out that this kind of extortion is exactly what's put them in hot water with congress and the American public and how I really didn't understand the timing of their decision to reduce my credit limit. Whatever motivated them COULD NOT have happened during the month they lowered my scores, because I subscribe to the credit monitoring services.

I had $200 in cash. What I wanted was $100 to go toward my credit card and to exchange the other $100 bill for $20s. Sounds simple enough, right? Apparently not! The teller (wish I remembered her name) took the first $100 bill, processed the payment and printed out the receipt.

Me: ""Ummm, I'm waiting for my $20 bills for the other $100 bill I gave you....""
Her: ""Didn't you only give me a $100?""
Me: ""No, I gave you two $100 bills.""
Her: ""Did you really?""

So she calls her manager over and tells her what happened. Then she said ""I got distracted because ______ interrupted me and asked me a question."" The manager tells her to count her drawer. Just great. So I have to stand there waiting for another 10 minutes because she didn't do her job. BS I tell you! When she was done, she laughed and said ""Oh, you were right."" Duh!!

Wells Fargo
Attn: Branch Manager
3002 N Central Ave
Phoenix, AZ, 85012

To Whom it May Concern,

I understand the customer is NOT always right. I understand that I am not now, nor will I ever be your best, most profitable customer. I don't make a lot of money, I am living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet. I am trying to get back on my feet to where I can live without floating one bill to pay another. I have a Second Chance account and I am trying to do the best so I can transition to a regular account. But none of this means your employees have the right to treat me like a second class citizen. You have to understand that in customer service, when a customer has a good experience, they tell one to two people. When the customer has a great experience they tell 3 to 4 people. On the opposite end of the spectrum. When a customer has a bad experience, they tell 10 to 12 people and when they have a horrible experience, they take to social media where they are visible to hundreds or even thousands of people. 
I am a relatively new customer to Wells Fargo. Since opening my accounts, I have been in several times for various transactions, usually depositing a paycheck (which are now direct deposited), and have really always received world-class service from your employees from the moment I would walk in, to the moment I left.
Yesterday was a completely different story. I will start by apologizing, as I was out of line at the end of the transaction. I drove off and flipped the teller off. I strongly feel though, that my actions at the END of this transaction do NOT validate your employees' treatment of me at the BEGINNING of the transaction. I was in a great mood because I finally received my tuition assistance check for $3669.00 from Arizona State University where I am a student. I rushed over to make it to your branch before they closed. I went through the drive through, only wanting to deposit this check. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes. The teller never apologized for the wait or explained what the hold up was, she just left us waiting. I am still in a great mood at this point though. Finally she comes back and advises simply that my check is being held. I ask why and until what date. This is when the conversation goes downhill. She tells me it is on hold until Tuesday because I have a Second Chance Bank Account and the check is from Bank of America and if I don't like that, I can go next door to Bank of America. 
Are you kidding me? Her first reaction is to tell me to take my business elsewhere?? Who does that?? She was so condescending and rude I was shocked. But I let it go and collected my ID, debit card and receipt. I noticed the receipt read the deposit was $3669 and that $3469 was being held. I pressed the call button and asked the teller about the $200 difference. She was clearly irritated with me at that point and tells me the entire amount is on hold as it clearly states on my receipt. I tell her its not clear on my receipt, that's why I am asking. She responds by telling me she is going to get her manager. What? Are you serious? Up to now, I have not talked back to her, I have not raised my voice, I have been completely respectful. The manager comes over. I try asking my questions again and she cuts me off saying as it clearly states on your receipt sir, the entire amount is being held. I say again, its not clear on my receipt. She again cuts me off and tells me its clear on my receipt. She cut me off and repeated herself 3 times. I was so furious I drove off and that is when I flipped her off. Again my apologies, but again, this does not validate how I was treated. I went into the branch as soon as they opened this morning and spoke with a manager. As soon as I told her I had gone through the drive through last night, she stopped me and said oh, ""you're the guy that flipped off my employees?"" and proceeds to lecture me as though I am a child and basically threatened to kick me out of the branch. Again, I had not raised my voice this entire time. She finally lets me explain what happened, and though she is verbally apologetic, it is clear she could absolutely care less. In fact, several times, she kept saying I don't know why they would have talked to you like that, I don't know what the circumstances were. There were no circumstances that I should have EVER been treated like that. Yes I flipped them off, but that was at the very end of the transaction as I was driving away. The manager never asked for my name or phone number, never said she would get back to me if she has other questions. She was just giving me lip service, and barely made any real effort at that.
Normally I can forgive and forget, but these two interactions from three employees are unforgivable and I am now questioning my loyalty as a customer.
What reason do I have to stay?

Sincerely,

Lucas R.",0.0584005876662097,0.881037217614091,0.0605621947196993,"review","esomNneHvsEv91MmraM5ug",1,2,2,301

Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell.

I have opened accounts at local banks (Arizona State Credit Union and National Bank of Arizona) to shift as much of my business as possible to local businesses.

Bank of America was just like that girlfriend (or boyfriend....trying to be equal opportunity here) who would NOT accept that it was over and move on. Trying to close my accounts was like pulling teeth. 

I sent a letter to the branch in California where I opened the account (because no one can seem to do anything ever if it's an out-of-state account) requesting the account be closed,. That letter was completely ignored. I then sent another letter (per the website instructions) to an address back  east again requesting closure of the account and pointing out that my last letter was ignored and not onset to the proper entity.

I received a letter with a form that needed to be notarized and sent back east to close the account. Or I could go to any Bank of America location for assistance. I chose the latter and walked into this location expecting to be told they couldn't help me and preparing to have a few choice words with the bank manager.

Instead I was greeted by the sweetest customer service associate, called Brianna. She was very helpful and efficient and did attempt to retain me as a customer. From our brief conversation she offered products and solutions to meet my financial needs and really put forth the warmest most genuine effort I have EVER experienced from a bank to deliver good service, look after me as a customer and retain my business.

My experience with her really made me second guess my choice to leave Bank of America because I felt so looked after and cared about. Unfortunately, especially at Bank of America, for every one of Brianna, there are about 1,000 associates who are incompetent, could care less, have rotten attitudes or all of the above.  So it was with that thought that I followed through.

I do have to say that  I have been impressed with other associates at this particular branch in the past. I recall a teller who had to deal with a rotten bitch of customer who was utterly rude and condescending. Without raising her voice or losing her cool, the teller gave that attitude RIGHT back to her. Unfortunately in customer service, killing customers with kindness sometimes invites more abuse so the best route may be to give it right back to an unreasonable person. This was one of those case and that teller handled it perfectly in my opinion. 

Needless to say, the bitch complained to the manager but after I concluded my business I went to the manager and told her how rotten that woman was and that the teller had, in my opinion, acted completely appropriately.

So this branch really stands out as best as it possibly can for Bank of America. It is still plagued long lines and waits which is frustrating but the service here has been noteworthy more than once for me.

I still believe firmly in supporting local business so I am happy with my decision to leave but for an institution which has demonstrated an consistent record of poor, impersonable service, this branch is a gem and I would recommend it to any Bank of American customers.

As for Brianna, she should be promoted to head of customer service because she could really make a difference I think in improving customer service at Bank of America. Her warmth and personality and caring nature make her better suited to a local bank.",0.0363062915777792,0.945053506551954,0.0186402018702672,"review","wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow",6,6,6,240

And I hate to tell you, Banks, but your customers have every right to demand damn near perfect service when they hand you their hard-earned money and expect to be able to transfer, store, and withdraw it without an issue.  Sometimes emotions run rampant because it's MONEY and it's a touchy subject period but if you can't take the heat get OUT of the kitchen.  

So that said - I had nothing but good experiences dealing with the ATMs and drive-thru at this location.  But the one and ONLY time I step foot into the bank - that's when the issues started.  Not one, not two, but three miserable problems in one visit.

So at the time I visited, about 3/4pm with my partner in crime in tow, we came for two different reasons - he wanted to talk to them about closing an account, I wanted to withdraw money as well as convert Japanese Yen into American Dollars.  

I asked the manager at the center console and she directs us to stand in line - that ""they can take care of all of that.""

We wait fifteen minutes, finally get to a teller who, after I mentioned I need to convert Yen, directs me to sit and wait to talk to a manager.  We sit, wait ten minutes, a manager then walks over and asks us what we were waiting for.  I tell her what we wanted.  She vanishes, then states that they only do conversions until TWO PM.  (What?)  I then mentioned the other two things we want to do and she directs us to a teller - to GET BACK IN LINE and wait another fifteen/twenty minutes to do what we originally waited in line and wanted to do!  

When I asked her why the staff had me get out of line and wanted me to wait TWICE and made me wait forty minutes for nothing for a policy that was listed NOWHERE within sight, she stated that she recently transferred from another state and the policies were different.  

NO APOLOGY.  No accepting responsibility.  None of that.  Simply, ""I didn't know.  Get back in line.""

Don't go through the pain and suffering I went through. Chase took about 5 years off of my life. 

I made the mistake of  using Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would ""take care of us"" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

If you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us.

Service is fake friendly until there is something semi challenging then no one is competent to help.

I phoned customer service to make sure my daily withdrawl limit was sufficient as I was playing in a large buyin tournament at the WSOP (I play poker professionally).  Customer service assured me it would be no problem and that I could make the withdrawl at any branch.

I came into the branch and the teller got the plump blonde manager over to approve the transaction (I had plenty of cash in my acct to cover it, nothing pending) and she simply wouldn't approve the transaction.  More than that she wouldn't give me any reason why.  WTF???

Remaining calm, I contacted support again.  They said I should be able to make the withdrawl, and they asked to speak to the branch manager.  The teller refused to touch my phone, and said there was no phone number support could reach them at, and they could not call out.  Comical.  The support agent on the phone laughed at the fact that the branch wouldn't talk to her and apologized to me.

Worse yet, the blonde manager remained in her office too busy eating or something to come out and address the issue.  I never raised my voice or acted unprofessionally towards anyone.
